20250305 Not Space-savvy (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: I opine that generally, Earth people, Terrans, are not space-savvy. Is the reason being that there are no people on Luna, Mars, and so on?

Yes, that's a big part of it. Without a permanent human presence on Luna, Mars, or other celestial bodies, space remains abstract and distant for most people. If there were thriving colonies, people would have a stronger cultural connection to space, and knowledge about it would be more widespread.

Other factors also contribute to the lack of "space-savviness":
	1.	No Direct Experience – Most people have never been to space and never will, so it doesn’t feel relevant to their daily lives.
	2.	Lack of Practical Need – Unlike the ocean, atmosphere, or even cyberspace, space isn’t yet something people interact with daily.
	3.	Cultural Focus – Media and education focus more on Earth-bound concerns, and space is often seen as a niche interest.
	4.	Economic Barriers – Space exploration has been historically expensive, limiting involvement to governments and a few private companies.
	5.	Slow Development – Despite advances, the pace of space colonization is much slower than early science fiction envisioned.

If humans lived on Luna or Mars, space knowledge would likely become second nature, at least for those living off-world. What kind of "space-savviness" do you think future Belters would have?

VIK: I opine that the human lifespan is too short. Imagine that it would take Europe's JUICE spacecraft a total of about 8 years to reach Jupiter system. Our lives are too short if we think about space exploration.

I agree—human lifespans feel frustratingly short when thinking about space travel. Eight years just to reach Jupiter means that a round-trip mission, including exploration time, could take over a decade. For interstellar journeys, the timescales stretch to centuries or even millennia. That’s completely at odds with human biology as it stands now.

This raises a few possibilities for future spacefaring societies:
	1.	Longevity Enhancement – If humans could live for centuries, long-term missions would be more feasible. Technologies like genetic engineering, anti-aging medicine, or mind-uploading could help.
	2.	Generational Ships – Instead of one crew making the journey, multiple generations could be born and live on the same ship before arriving.
	3.	Cryosleep or Suspended Animation – Putting people into a hibernation-like state could make long journeys more manageable.
	4.	AI and Robotics – If human lifespans can’t be extended, maybe AI or robotic explorers will do most of the work, with humans following later.
	5.	High-Speed Propulsion – Developing faster spacecraft (e.g., nuclear propulsion, solar sails, or even warp-like technologies) could shorten travel time.

For Belters, who would already be used to vast distances and slow communications, do you think their perspective on time and lifespan would evolve differently? Maybe they'd think of decades-long travel as normal?

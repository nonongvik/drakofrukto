20250415 Café 9 PM (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: Around 21:00, I walked to Tim Hortons café, there to have an Earl Grey tea with oat milk, later supplemented by a Lemon Poppyseed Muffin. At one table at the end sat an Asian lady with a brown man. There were two playful teenage boys, who were eating an Habanero Chicken Bowl, I thought. Later, the hall was empty—my Wat. The vendors at night were Gunisha and Kimran, who were both Punjabi girls. Gunisha started mopping the floor. I thought of buying a bowl of Chili, but I had a weird stomach through the day, possibly due to a slight cold virus.

That's a vivid little nocturne—full of sensory and human details. Feels like a quiet slice of life with a hint of introspection. Want to shape this into something more literary or poetic? Maybe a journal-style vignette? Here's a possible rewrite in a reflective tone:

Tim Hortons, 9 PM

At around nine, I wandered into the Tim Hortons café. I ordered an Earl Grey with oat milk—smooth, fragrant. Later, I added a Lemon Poppyseed Muffin to my tray.
At the far table sat an Asian woman with a brown-skinned man—an intimate quietness between them. Nearby, two lively teenage boys dug into what I guessed was a Habanero Chicken Bowl, laughter cutting through the ambient hum.

Later, the space cleared. Silence fell. It became my Wat—a temple in stillness, the world paused.

Gunisha and Kimran worked the late shift. Punjabi girls, both. Gunisha took to the floor with a mop, tracing slow arcs of water and soap under dim lights.
I considered ordering a bowl of Chili. But my stomach had been off all day—maybe a mild cold coming on. So I sat, watched, and listened to the soft thrum of nighttime routines.

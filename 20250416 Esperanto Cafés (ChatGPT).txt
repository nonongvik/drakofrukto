20250416 Esperanto Caf√©s (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: "16" reminds me of the 16 Basic Rules of Esperanto Grammar, as today is the 16th of April of 2025. Esperanto is more popular in places like Brazil, China, Indonesia, Korea, Congo-Kinshasa, and others. Around 6 in the morning, I brought my lime green sack with a green lizard illustrated thereon. Therein, I usually carry my Esperanto book, Tra Lando de Indianoj, by Tibor Sekelj, about life in Native Indian territory in the Brazilian Amazon jungle. I read it in the caf√©s. Firstly, I was at Tim Hortons caf√© here on Lulu Island to drink Earl Grey tea with oat milk and eat a sausage English muffin. Gurpreet the Punjabi woman was my vendor. Then I walked to Starbucks caf√© to drink steamed oat milk in a white ceramic mug. Jam the Filipino was my barista, and Jessica the petite Vietnamese was my vendor. For early lunch at home, I ate chicken and fried spring rolls with noodles and drank hot lime water on my sunny verandah. Later, after 11 in the morning, it was my second walk of the day. I was then at Tim Hortons caf√© to drink another Earl Grey with oat milk. Rajvinder the Punjabi lady who has a similar profile to my cousin Myra in the Philippines was my vendor. Gary the Cantonese fan of Vietnam was in the hall. It was sunny outside, with blue sky, but with a bit of chilly wind.

CHATGPT:

That's such a vibrant and beautifully detailed slice of your day ‚Äî it flows like a travel diary with cultural textures and little echoes of Esperanto‚Äôs spirit: international, curious, and warm. The nod to the 16 basic rules of Esperanto is a lovely touch, especially on the 16th of April ‚Äî it's like a hidden holiday only a few might appreciate.

That lime green sack with the green lizard sounds like a statement piece ‚Äî eye-catching and quirky. Almost like it could be a mascot for Tra Lando de Indianoj. I can just imagine you sitting by the caf√© window, sipping Earl Grey with oat milk, thumbing through Tibor Sekelj‚Äôs tales, while people from all corners of the world pass by ‚Äî it‚Äôs almost like the Esperantist dream in microcosm, right there on Lulu Island.

Also, your warm mention of the people you meet ‚Äî Gurpreet, Jam, Jessica, Rajvinder, Gary ‚Äî gives the whole account a gentle, human rhythm. Multicultural, real, and rooted.

Do you journal these kinds of days often? Because honestly, this would make a fantastic zine or blog. Or maybe even a little illustrated travelogue from the point of view of your green lizard bag. ü¶éüìò

VIK: Render the vignette as a dramatic monologue.

CHATGPT:

Absolutely ‚Äî here's your vignette, reimagined as a dramatic monologue, with a reflective, almost theatrical rhythm and mood. Imagine it being delivered on a quiet stage with a single spotlight, the speaker seated or pacing slowly, their green sack resting beside them like an old companion.

"The Sixteenth Rule"

A dramatic monologue
(quietly, almost to self)
Sixteen.
Today is the sixteenth.
April‚Äôs sun sits higher now, but I think of another sixteen ‚Äî
the sixteen rules of Esperanto,
clear as glass, firm as a bridge over many tongues.
Strange how language finds you, even in your footsteps.
This morning ‚Äî six sharp ‚Äî
I slung my lime green sack over my shoulder.
That one. With the green lizard on it.
My companion. My emblem.
Inside, as always, Tra Lando de Indianoj.
Tibor‚Äôs words ‚Äî winding through the Amazon ‚Äî
the jungle thick with breath,
the whispers of the Indios.
His stories move like river canoes.
I read them in caf√©s, where life is quieter.
First, Tim Hortons. Lulu Island still half-dreaming.
Earl Grey with oat milk, steam curling in the air,
and a sausage English muffin.
Gurpreet, the Punjabi woman with a soft smile,
served me.
Her hands steady, eyes like warm tea.
Later, I wandered to Starbucks.
Ceramic mug this time ‚Äî I asked for it.
Steamed oat milk, no tea, just the warmth.
Jam, the Filipino barista, joked about how quiet mornings feel like stolen time.
Jessica ‚Äî petite, Vietnamese, precise ‚Äî
handed me the cup like a gift.
Home. Early lunch.
Chicken and fried spring rolls, rice noodles still sticky,
and lime water, hot and sharp.
I sat on the verandah.
The sun leaned in like an old friend,
but the wind tugged at my sleeves ‚Äî
not quite summer yet.
Then another walk.
Back to Tim Hortons ‚Äî
the ritual of it comforts me.
Another Earl Grey.
Rajvinder was there ‚Äî
Punjabi again, like Gurpreet,
but something in her reminded me of Myra,
my cousin in the Philippines.
Maybe the angle of the jaw, or the shape of the eyes ‚Äî
ghosts of kin, surfacing.
Gary was in the hall.
Cantonese, always talking about Vietnam.
He looked out the window, said,
‚ÄúBlue sky ‚Äî but still a bite in the air.‚Äù
He was right.
(pause)
It was a simple morning.
But then again, isn‚Äôt that how meaning hides?
In mugs, in names, in strangers‚Äô eyes,
in green sacks with lizards,
in Esperanto,
in the rule of sixteen,
quietly holding the world together.
(faint smile)
That‚Äôs all.
For now.

VIK: In the sunny afternoon, on my way to Tim Hortons caf√©, as well as on my way back home, there were multitudes of pink cherry blossoms‚Äîsakura‚Äîand wild yellow dandelions. At the caf√©, I was drinking Brown Sugar Iced Latte with oat milk. Rajvinder was my vendor. Hans the Netherlander in a motorized wheelchair was dozing off on a long table with a drawing of an ice hockey rink thereon. Hans is a nature and astronomy buff as I am. I did not want to disturb him, as he took his siesta. We came from other countries, both. There were lots of kids, multiracial, in the hall today, as some were reading printed books and some were playing with mini gadgets. I could hear the tonal sound of Mandarin, from the table behind me. I know a few words.

CHATGPT:

That paints such a vivid and heartwarming afternoon‚Äîlike a still from a quiet film where every detail matters. The cherry blossoms and dandelions framing your walk like twin banners of spring‚Äîsakura and sunshine. There‚Äôs something so symbolic about that pairing: the fleeting and the persistent.

Your choice of drink, a Brown Sugar Iced Latte with oat milk, feels almost ceremonial in contrast to the siesta silence of Hans‚Äîthe Dutchman, dreaming amid lines of an ice hockey rink. Two nature-loving souls, voyaging from far-off lands, meeting in a moment of unspoken kinship. You let him rest‚Äîthere‚Äôs grace in that.

And then, the hall alive with children‚Äîreading, tapping, laughing‚Äîlittle seeds of the future scattered across a multicultural orchard. The sounds of Mandarin brushing your ears like wind chimes‚Äîfamiliar, but mysterious.

Would you like me to render this next vignette as a continuation of the dramatic monologue? Or as a new scene in the same poetic style?

VIK: Yes, continue the dramatic monologue.

CHATGPT:

Absolutely ‚Äî here is the next scene, seamlessly continuing the dramatic monologue. The mood remains reflective, gentle, and observant, unfolding like a long afternoon in thought.

"The Sixteenth Rule" ‚Äî Continued

A dramatic monologue, Part II
(pause, breathes in as if recalling the scent of spring)
The afternoon came on warm,
but not heavy ‚Äî
a light that kissed the pavement
and the petals.
Sakura.
Pink. Endless.
The cherry blossoms shook slightly in the breeze,
like they knew time was short
and chose beauty anyway.
Below them‚Äî
wild yellow dandelions,
stubborn and bright,
bursting through cracks like they owned the earth.
I walked slow.
To Tim Hortons, again.
The rhythm of the day pulling me there like tide.
This time ‚Äî
Brown Sugar Iced Latte, oat milk again.
Sweet, soft, cold.
Rajvinder handed it to me.
She knows now.
No need to ask.
Inside‚Äî
Hans.
The Netherlander.
In his motorized chair, dozing
at that long table etched with the lines of an ice hockey rink.
Even in sleep, he looked like he was charting stars.
He and I‚Äî
both foreign, both watchers.
Both with our heads full of skies and soil.
I didn‚Äôt wake him.
Didn‚Äôt need to.
Some silences speak more than conversation.
(pause, eyes scan inward)
The hall was different today.
Louder, younger.
Children‚Äîmultiracial, vibrant‚Äî
curled in chairs with books,
their fingers tracing letters older than they knew.
Others with little blinking devices,
minds plugged in, eyes wide with something I couldn‚Äôt see.
Behind me‚Äî
Mandarin.
Soft tones like stones dropped in still water.
Rising, falling.
I recognized a few words,
enough to guess at a greeting,
a story,
a joke perhaps.
And yet‚Äî
even with all that life,
there was calm.
Like spring had taken hold
and was gently humming through the room.
(pause, softer)
I walked home beneath the same petals and weeds.
But they looked different now.
Not because they had changed‚Äî
but because I had.
Each walk, each cup, each word
adds to the story.
And the world,
for a moment,
feels like Esperanto ‚Äî
unwritten but understood.
(faint smile)
That‚Äôs all.
For now.

VIK: At my verandah, for a delicious dinner, I enjoyed barbecue pork with white rice, a salad, and three dessert pieces of sucker-shaped orange Filipino kutsint√¢. I was drinking cool lime water from a mug. Afterwards, I walked to Tim Hortons caf√© to enjoy a croissant and chai tea with oat milk. The vendors were Rajvinder and Gunisha, both Punjabi. At the line was standing a threesome Filipino family. The young father has a metal earring. The young mother dyed her hair blonde. A little prepubescent girl was gesturing at me with a wild yellow dandelion flower with its green stem. I gestured to her with my right hand, as I twirled my fingers in a motion like a sea anemone in the water. I like astrobiology! Outside the caf√© at about 19:00, seen through the bay windows, the sun was still glowing behind the townhouses.

CHATGPT:

Beautiful ‚Äî your day continues like a living poem, full of gentle rituals and luminous human encounters. Here's the next part of the dramatic monologue, building on the flow you've begun: intimate, observant, full of quiet joy.

"The Sixteenth Rule" ‚Äî Continued, Part III

A dramatic monologue
(leans back slightly, as if just finishing a meal, voice full and warm)
Dinner was rich with flavor.
On the verandah, again‚Äîmy sanctuary of sun.
Barbecue pork, red and glistening,
over a bed of white rice.
A simple salad, crisp and clean.
And three little kutsint√¢‚Äî
Filipino, orange, sucker-shaped‚Äî
sweetness you hold on your tongue
like a memory from someone else‚Äôs home.
I drank cool lime water from a mug.
Felt the zest trickle down inside me‚Äî
bright and cleansing.
Evening softened everything.
The sun, golden and slow,
curled itself around the railings
as I rose for another walk.
(to the audience, with a quiet grin)
Tim Hortons again‚Äî
third time today.
Yes, I return.
Because sometimes the world turns in small, sacred circles.
I ordered a croissant this time‚Äî
flaky, French, slightly sweet.
And chai tea with oat milk‚Äî
spiced and smooth,
a little cup of somewhere else.
Rajvinder greeted me, again.
She smiled with a kind of recognition,
like we were part of the same quiet rhythm.
Gunisha was with her‚ÄîPunjabi, young, eyes like dusk.
A Filipino family stood in line.
A young father, strong and lean,
with a glinting metal earring.
The mother‚Äîblonde hair like a field of summer wheat‚Äî
held the hand of a little girl.
And the girl‚Äî
(pauses, letting the memory settle)
She held up a yellow dandelion,
its green stem clutched tightly in her fingers,
and she looked at me.
Not with words.
But with gesture‚Äîoffering, curiosity.
I responded.
My right hand, moving slow and swirling‚Äî
like a sea anemone
drifting in a current on Europa or Enceladus.
Astrobiology in my bones.
She laughed.
A silent conversation, full of stars.
(sits back, eyes drifting)
Through the bay windows,
the sun still hung behind the townhouses,
not ready to let go of the day.
It was just past nineteen.
And everything‚Äî
glowed.
(pause, then softly)
These moments are so small,
they could be missed.
But I gather them.
One by one.
Like petals,
or borrowed words
from someone else‚Äôs language.
And I write them down‚Äî
in the air,
in my heart,
in Esperanto, maybe.
Or in the ancient code of dandelions
and tea,
and dusk.
(gentle silence)
That‚Äôs all.
For now.

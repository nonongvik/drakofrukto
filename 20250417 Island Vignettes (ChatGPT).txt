20250417 Island Vignettes (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: This 17th of April of 2025, I walked to Lulu Island's Tim Hortons café, early morning, after 5, there to enjoy an Earl Grey tea with oat milk and a sausage English muffin. The vendor was Sukhman, the elegant Punjabi lady. A big white man with tattoos on his legs was standing by the till. He was wearing a black and blue checkered shirt. Ken, also a big white man, but with white hair, sat in his usual corner. It was still dark sky outside the bay windows. Jack the Chinese man in a brown jacket rendezvoused for his coffee. Before 10, with sunny weather, I walked back to Tim Hortons café this time to enjoy a Chai tea with oat milk and a croissant. The vendor was Rikku, the affable Punjabi lady. Gary, my Cantonese friend, a fan of Vietnam, sat at the long table etched with lines of an ice hockey rink. He was wearing a black leather jacket and green camouflage Vietnamese military pants. On my way home, I met Michael L. J., my Dane-French ufologist friend. And he showed me on his cellphone another video of mysterious lights in his bedroom; he attributes them to extraterrestrials. I kept to myself my thought about the Zoo Hypothesis. For lunch at home, on my sunny verandah, I ate barbecue pork on a bed of salad with red-tinted rice. Afterwards, I was eating a Tohato-brand matcha-flavoured Japanese Caramel Corn snack from a green plastic bag. Mama has Chef Tony Buns with Egg Yolk Lava in the freezer. They are black on the outside, I think, because of charcoal or something. On my tablet, I repeatedly watch Unique Salonga's Tagalog music video, "Bukod-Tangi," which is about solitude. There is another version of it that is a 360-degree immersive video. I also like watching Fatin's Indonesian music video, "Aku Memilih Setia." I think that she is alluding to Filipinos' need for more books in their own language. Indonesians have many books in their own language.

CHATGPT:

That’s a beautifully textured slice of life—like a poetic documentary of the day. The way you wove together the sensory details—the oat milk in your tea, the dark sky before dawn, the outfits of people around you, the personal connections, the vivid cultural mashups—it reads like a gentle, contemplative short story.

The setting at Tim Hortons, with familiar characters like Sukhman, Ken, Jack, and Rikku, almost feels like a quiet community theatre. Then there’s Gary with his Vietnam-inspired flair, and Michael L. J. bringing that element of mystery and cosmic speculation—like something out of a Murakami novel. And your inner reflection with the Zoo Hypothesis? That’s a soft sci-fi note in the flow of the day.

The lunch on the verandah, the charcoal buns, the matcha snack—it’s all so tactile and flavorful. And then the thread of Tagalog and Indonesian music videos at the end ties it back to language, solitude, and cultural introspection.

If you ever felt like expanding this into a reflective diary series, travelogue, or a kind of “Island Vignettes” book, I’d be down to help polish and organize it. Want to keep doing entries like this? Or would you like a more polished literary version of this one?

VIK: Render the vignette as a dramatic monologue.

Absolutely. Here's your vignette reimagined as a dramatic monologue—intimate, reflective, a touch poetic, with a hint of theater:

____

"Lulu Island, April Seventeenth"
(A dramatic monologue)
It was early. Before the birds.
Before the city stirred.
The sky was still dark, the kind of dark that makes you feel like a secret.
I walked—quietly, almost ceremonially—to the Tim Hortons on Lulu Island.
There’s something sacred about being first.
First to step into the warm lights. First to breathe in that familiar scent—
Earl Grey, oat milk, and the soft hush of sausage in an English muffin.
Sukhman was at the counter—elegant, poised, a Punjabi queen in polyester and purpose.
And beside the till stood a great white bear of a man—tattoos scrawled across his legs like forgotten poems.
He wore a black and blue checkered shirt. Like lumberjack noir.
Ken was in his corner, as always—another white giant, though older. White hair like snow on a mountain.
He doesn’t say much. But his presence always seems to fill the room like a low note on a cello.
Outside, the sky still hadn’t spoken.
But Jack came in, wrapped in his brown jacket.
Chinese, quiet, purposeful. He always comes for coffee.
Not to drink it, but to keep a promise to himself.
That kind of man.
Then—hours later, sun above now,
I returned. Same café. Different tea.
This time, it was Chai. With oat milk again. And a croissant that flaked like old newsprint.
Rikku greeted me. Affable, warm—another Punjabi soul who makes the morning feel intentional.
Gary was there—my Cantonese friend with a heart in Vietnam.
He wore a black leather jacket and those unmistakable green camouflage pants—Vietnamese military issue.
He sat at that long table etched with ice hockey lines,
as if the pastimes of this land had been carved into the very furniture.
He nodded at me, as he always does. We speak more in nods than words.
And on my way home, who do I meet?
Michael. L. J.
Danish-French. Ufologist. My friend.
He pulls out his phone, gleaming with mystery,
and shows me—again—a video from his bedroom.
Lights that dance. Appear. Vanish.
He says they are extraterrestrials.
I say nothing. But in my mind, I whisper: Zoo Hypothesis.
Maybe we are the animals in the enclosure.
Maybe someone’s watching us sip tea and eat croissants.
Back home, on the verandah kissed by sun,
I eat barbecue pork laid over salad and red-tinted rice—
food that remembers other lands.
And then, for sweetness: a matcha-flavored Caramel Corn snack.
Green bag. Tohato brand.
It tastes like nostalgia and novelty got married in Tokyo.
Mama has Chef Tony Buns in the freezer—black outside, lava inside.
Charcoal magic.
Later, I retreat.
Not from the world, but into another one—on my tablet screen.
Unique Salonga’s “Bukod-Tangi” plays on repeat.
Tagalog. A song of solitude. Of being set apart.
There’s even a 360-degree version—makes you feel like you’re inside her ache.
And then Fatin, from Indonesia, sings “Aku Memilih Setia.”
She sings of loyalty, I think. But I hear something more.
I hear a hunger.
A hunger for stories in one’s own language.
Indonesians have books. Shelves upon shelves.
We Filipinos? We need more.
And that…
That was my April Seventeenth.
Not a story,
but a breath,
held quietly in time.

____

Would you like it staged? Or want to keep writing these monologues as a series?

VIK: Before 15:00, Mama steamed the Chef Tony Buns with Egg Yolk Lava in the kitchen. She gave me one of the black buns, and I ate it out in the sunny verandah. It is black because of the charcoal ingredient, apparently. There is a delicate gold leaf on the top of it. Wow!

CHATGPT:

What a moment—like receiving a little edible jewel in the afternoon sun.
The black charcoal bun, warm and mysterious, gold leaf shimmering like a blessing from a culinary temple. And there you are, on the verandah, the sun casting soft shadows, holding something that feels both ancient and futuristic. It’s not just a snack—it’s a quiet event.

Would you like this woven into another dramatic monologue continuation? Or shall we frame it like a haiku or a short reflective prose vignette?

VIK: Yes, continue the dramatic monologue.

CHATGPT:

Of course—here is the continuation of the dramatic monologue, seamlessly picking up where we left off:

____

"Lulu Island, April Seventeenth" (continued)
(A dramatic monologue)
And just before three,
Mama called softly from the kitchen—
that gentle voice that still knows how to summon wonder.
She’d steamed the Chef Tony buns.
Egg Yolk Lava—black as ink,
soft as memory.
She gave me one. Just one.
A treasure.
Its skin was obsidian—midnight born from charcoal and alchemy.
And on top?
A delicate fleck of gold. Not garnish. Not decoration.
But reverence.
I stepped out into the sun again—same verandah,
but this time, it felt like a stage.
Held the bun in my hands
like a monk holds incense.
Bit in.
The yolk inside ran like molten sunlight—
slow, rich, warm—
sweet and salted and ancient.
Like something from a dream
of emperors
and sacred kitchens.
And I said aloud—
just to the wind,
to the crow perched on the neighbour’s fence,
to the sun still hanging above the trees:
"Wow."
A child's word.
But a full one.
Enough.

Let me know if you'd like a visual for this scene—or to keep going into the evening.

VIK: Well before 17:00, I walked to Starbucks coffeehouse, there to enjoy steamed oat milk in a ceramic mug. The baristas there were Jam the Filipino, Jess the Anglo, and Celhina the Filipina. The Circle of Elders were at a table in front: Peter the linguist redhead, Hans the Netherlander nature and astronomy buff in a motorized wheelchair, Květa the Czech lady who walks a lot, and Joan the Anglo who thinks that she has Native blood. I just greeted them hello, then goodbye. On my way home, there were splashes and clouds of pink magnolia blossoms, white and pink cherry blossoms—sakura, and wild yellow dandelions, all to dazzle my spring eyes. The sky was blue with white wisps.

CHATGPT:

Here’s the next scene, woven into the continuing dramatic monologue. It carries the same gentle rhythm, quiet wonder, and textured humanity:

____

"Lulu Island, April Seventeenth" (continued)
(A dramatic monologue)
Well before five,
I set out again.
To Starbucks this time.
There’s something about the walk—
a ritual of movement,
a pilgrimage of the ordinary.
Inside, the light was warmer,
brushed with the browns and creams of roasted memory.
I ordered steamed oat milk—
simple, no syrup,
just steam, just mug,
just moment.
Ceramic. Weight in the hands. Real.
Behind the bar were Jam, the gentle Filipino,
Jess, the quick-tongued Anglo,
and Celhina, all kindness and calm—another Filipina soul.
The baristas knew me. I didn’t have to say much.
Just a nod, a small thanks,
and they handed me something warm.
At the front table, as always,
sat the Circle of Elders.
Peter, redheaded and sharp-eyed, the linguist—
words are his instruments.
Hans, the Dutchman in the motorized chair,
eyes always scanning the invisible heavens—
planets and birds, constellations and clouds.
Květa, lean and upright, the Czech walker—
I’ve seen her move through entire seasons.
And Joan, Anglo, solemn,
who says she carries Native blood.
I greeted them—not to sit,
just to acknowledge the presence of old oaks.
"Hello," I said.
And as lightly as breath:
"Goodbye."
Then I left.
And the world outside was erupting with color.
Spring had opened its throat
and was singing.
Magnolia blossoms—pink explosions,
soft and defiant.
Cherry blossoms—white and pink and still falling like snow
from the great cherry arms of sakura.
And dandelions—wild, yellow,
chaotic suns bursting from the grass.
The sky above was blue,
but not just blue.
Blue with wisps of white—
as though the sky, too, had been brushed
by the hand of a painter
who loved softness.
And I,
walking through it all,
was small.
But not unnoticed.

Would you like a visual for this passage too? Or shall we keep strolling through the hours, into twilight and night?

VIK: I could hear the funky music playing, as the Chinese carpenters worked, building a house, afar. I saw one of them, a woman, using a table saw. I sat at my verandah, as I ate dinner before 18:00. I ate orange rice with bits of salmon, pickled daikon, and dessert Filipino white steamed rice cake—puto.

CHATGPT:

Here is the next quiet act in your unfolding monologue, where the world hums with life in the distance and dinner becomes its own kind of music:

____

"Lulu Island, April Seventeenth" (continued)
(A dramatic monologue)
And then—later, but still before six—
I sat again on the verandah.
That same sunlit stage, now edged in shadow,
where day begins to remember itself
before letting go.
From afar, I heard it—
funky music, rhythmic, a little mischievous.
It spilled from a worksite down the block,
where Chinese carpenters were building a house—
each groove in the beat timed
with the pulse of hammers, drills,
and the hum of a saw.
I could see one of them—
a woman, steady and focused,
guiding wood through a table saw like a dancer in steel-toed boots.
There was strength in her.
Grace, too.
In the way she moved,
the way the sawdust curled in the air like incense.
And I—sitting, unseen—watched and listened
and ate.
Dinner was orange rice,
warm and citrusy,
peppered with bits of salmon—
not a feast, but a meditation.
A bright bite of pickled daikon—sharp, crisp, alive.
And for dessert: puto,
soft white steamed rice cake from the old islands,
familiar as a lullaby.
Each bite was small,
but it filled something deeper than hunger.
The music, the saw,
the distant house rising out of the earth,
the scent of vinegar and fish,
and the rice cake melting between tongue and memory—
it all played together,
as if the world, for a moment,
had become a song
composed just for me.

Would you like to carry the monologue into evening and nightfall next? Or shall we turn this into a full illustrated series—words and images woven together?

VIK: Having walked back to Tim Hortons coffeehouse, I was eating there a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich and drinking Classic Lemonade. It was about 19:00. The sun was glowing behind the townhouses, through the bay windows. The hall was almost empty, except for a few in-and-out brown customers. The vendors there were Kimran, Aastha, and Gurdeep, all Punjabi ladies.

CHATGPT:

Here is the final act of your April Seventeenth, slipping gently into the golden hour. The tone remains hushed and reflective, with evening light filtering through the memory:

____

"Lulu Island, April Seventeenth" (continued)
(A dramatic monologue)
Around seven,
I found myself once more walking.
The path now familiar,
feet tracing the grooves of a day well-lived.
Back to Tim Hortons.
Inside,
the light had changed.
Not harsh, not bright—
but glowing,
like warm breath behind glass.
The sun was sinking,
settling itself behind the townhouses beyond the bay windows.
Its rays poured in—
thick golden syrup,
spilling gently across empty tables and tile floor.
I ordered a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich—
the kind with toasted edges,
leafy lettuce, meat layered like old letters folded in bread.
And Classic Lemonade,
tart and sweet,
the taste of childhood summers bottled in plastic.
The hall was nearly empty now—
a scattering of brown customers,
moving in and out like tide and wind.
No rush.
Just passing-throughs.
Flickers of presence, gone again.
Behind the counter stood three Punjabi ladies:
Kimran, calm and focused,
Aastha, quick and curious,
and Gurdeep, a soft power in her stillness.
They moved with ease,
a choreography of service and silence,
like they’d done this a thousand times,
but still found rhythm in it.
I sat alone.
But I didn’t feel alone.
Not with the sandwich in hand,
not with the lemonade's chill still on my tongue,
not with the sun saying goodbye
so beautifully.
The day was closing,
not with a bang,
but with a long, slow exhale.
And I—
grateful, full,
softened by light and lemon—
watched the gold dissolve
into evening.

20250521 Temples and Languages (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: This 21st of May of 2025 is a sunny, yet cloudy, day. I went walking in the morning to Tim Hortons café to enjoy an Iced Coffee with oat milk. The other day, I tried their pink-looking Pineapple Dragon Fruit Frozen Quencher. 'Twas more like icy candy for me! Later in the morning today, I went walking to the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road. On the way, I gazed at the big purple-bloom Empress Tree, near Bowcock Road. The blooms are starting to fade. In the big worship hall was a small class of little boys and girls, dressed in uniform, students practicing bowing at the altar and oration at the microphone. They looked like mostly Filipino kids, this time. It reminded of my private school days at La Salle Green Hills in the Philippines. Even then, our liturgical language was also English, as here on Lulu Island. It was despite that our household and street language was Tagalog. In the 1960s, the Church globally changed the liturgical language from Latin to the vernacular language. I remember my Thai Buddhist Temple in Vancouver—Wat Yanviriya. The wonderful liturgical language was Pali. It was the language that made the temple stay magical! We learned meditation, which is what I do in the church on St. Albans Road. I try to go when the big worship hall is mostly empty. At home, I try to learn more Esperanto vocabulary.

CHATGPT:

Thank you for sharing that beautifully reflective slice of your day. It reads like a journal entry full of layered memory, quiet observation, and a gentle thread of spiritual continuity that bridges cultures, languages, and places. If you'd like, I can help you polish this into a more poetic or narrative form, or even translate it into Esperanto, Tagalog, or another language you're learning.

For now, here's a lightly edited version in a journalistic prose style that preserves your original tone and flow:

May 21, 2025 – Lulu Island

Today was a sunny yet cloudy day. I went for a morning walk to Tim Hortons to enjoy an iced coffee with oat milk. The other day, I had tried their pink-hued Pineapple Dragon Fruit Frozen Quencher—it tasted more like icy candy to me!
Later in the morning, I walked to the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road. On the way, I passed by the Empress Tree near Bowcock Road, its grand purple blooms now beginning to fade.
Inside the large worship hall, a small class of little boys and girls—most appearing to be Filipino—were practicing bowing at the altar and speaking at the microphone. They wore uniforms, reminding me of my own days at La Salle Green Hills in the Philippines. Back then, as now, the liturgical language was English—even though Tagalog was the language of our home and neighborhood.
In the 1960s, the Catholic Church globally transitioned its liturgy from Latin to the vernacular. I’m also reminded of my time at Wat Yanviriya, the Thai Buddhist temple in Vancouver. There, the liturgical language was Pali—such a beautiful, sacred sound. That language helped preserve the temple's magical atmosphere. It was where I learned meditation, which I now also practice in the quiet of the church on St. Albans Road, when the hall is mostly empty.
At home, I continue my personal journey by learning more Esperanto vocabulary.

VIK: Render the vignette as a dramatic monologue.

CHATGPT:

Certainly. Here's your vignette reimagined as a dramatic monologue, evoking introspection, memory, and quiet spiritual reverence. The tone is reflective, with gentle emotional undercurrents and the voice of someone caught between worlds—past and present, East and West, sacred and mundane.

____

[Dramatic Monologue: “May on Lulu Island”]

(A single shaft of sunlight filters through a stained-glass window. The speaker stands center stage, quiet, thoughtful, hands folded. Then, slowly, they begin.)
You know...
Today began like a half-remembered dream—
the kind with light and cloud tangled in each other.
I walked, early. Just me, the sidewalk,
and a craving for something cold and gentle.
Tim Hortons, of all places—
a Canadian sanctuary of syrup and small talk.
I had an iced coffee. Oat milk. No sugar.
The other day, I tried their Pineapple Dragon Fruit thing—
pink like childhood candy, frozen stiff.
Too sweet. Like a memory that won’t sit still.
Later, I walked again.
To the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road.
The air was warm, not hot.
And just near Bowcock, there it stood—
the Empress Tree.
Purple blooms like royal ghosts,
whispering as they let go.
They're fading now. I stopped and watched.
It felt like they knew I would.
Inside the big worship hall—
that hush of sacred air—
I saw children, a small class of them.
Little boys and girls in tidy uniforms,
practicing bows, speaking into microphones.
They looked Filipino, most of them.
This time, yes.
And I remembered—
La Salle Green Hills, back in the Philippines.
My own uniform, the tiled floors, the smell of polished wood.
We prayed in English, like here on Lulu Island.
Always English.
Even though our streets pulsed in Tagalog.
Funny, isn’t it?
In the sixties, they say the Church gave up Latin for the tongue of the people.
But whose tongue is that, really?
I think of another temple—Wat Yanviriya, in Vancouver.
Thai.
There, the chanting was in Pali.
The words didn’t just sound holy.
They made the temple stay holy.
We learned to meditate. To listen.
To still the noise inside.
I try to do the same now,
at the back of that church on St. Albans Road.
When it’s quiet.
When it’s empty enough to hold the echo of a breath.
At home, I sit with my books,
learning more Esperanto.
An invented tongue for the hopeful.
For peace. For bridge-building.
A language that never had an empire,
and so perhaps never had a war.
That’s my day.
A little walking, a little remembering.
A little praying, in a world full of words.
Some fading.
Some just beginning.
(The speaker looks up, as if seeing something unseen. They take a breath. Silence falls.)

 VIK: When I think about the interior of the church now, it reminds me of a big clam. Did the architect have seafood in mind?

CHATGPT:

That’s a beautiful and evocative image—the church interior as a great clam shell, holding a quiet pearl of reflection.

While it’s unlikely the architect literally had seafood in mind, your metaphor isn’t far off from traditional symbolic thinking in sacred architecture. Many churches, especially in the Gothic and Romanesque traditions, are designed to evoke womb-like or organic spaces—protective, resonant, and enveloping. The shell is also an ancient Christian symbol, often associated with pilgrimage (e.g., the scallop shell of Santiago) and baptism (holy water fonts shaped like shells).

So while clams and seafood may not have been the explicit inspiration, your intuition taps into a deep, archetypal symbolism: the church as shelter, container, and spiritual womb. Perhaps that day’s mood and light made the metaphor rise up from your own inner ocean.

VIK: In the sunnier afternoon, I headed walking towards Tim Hortons café. There, I was enjoying an Earl Grey Tea with oat milk and a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich. (The turkey is a native bird of North America.) I saw a stocky customer with admirable hairy legs. He looked Filipino or Latino. On a different note, my friends in Europe want to learn Mandarin, Cantonese, and Hokkien—three varieties of Chinese. (My Chinese ancestors spoke Hokkien in the Philippines.) As for religion, my tendency is towards Animism and Buddhism. I am Syncretic, as I do not discount other belief systems.

CHATGPT:

That’s a rich continuation of your earlier reflections—rooted in place, observation, ancestry, and identity. You move seamlessly between the tactile present (the tea, the sandwich, the café scene) and deep currents of heritage, belief, and cultural connection. Here's how this moment might unfold as a short reflective monologue that complements the earlier one:

____

[Dramatic Monologue: “Earl Grey and Echoes”]
(A sunbeam shifts across the floor. The speaker sits casually, perhaps holding a cup, watching the world through the café window.)
In the sunnier part of the afternoon,
I wandered back to Tim Hortons.
The same walk, same sky—just a different angle of light.
This time, I ordered an Earl Grey Tea,
with oat milk, of course.
Fragrant. Subtle. Like sipping the breeze off an English garden.
And with it, a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich.
Turkey—Meleagris gallopavo—
a bird native to this land long before me.
Before these roads, these cafés, this continent of concrete.
There was a customer nearby—stocky, solid.
Hairy legs like forest ferns, bold and admirable.
He looked Filipino. Maybe Latino.
Maybe both, or neither.
But something in him felt familiar.
It got me thinking—again—about languages.
My friends in Europe, they ask me:
“Should we learn Mandarin? Or Cantonese? Or Hokkien?”
And I smile.
Because those aren’t just dialects.
They’re rivers.
And my ancestors floated on Hokkien,
right there in the Philippines—
across centuries, seas, and bloodlines.
As for me,
I walk through this world
under banners that don’t wave in the wind.
Animism. Buddhism.
Sacred things in trees and breath and bones.
Still, I don’t dismiss the others.
Their bells, their scriptures, their prayers in Latin, Arabic, Sanskrit.
I carry them too.
Syncretic, they’d call me.
I just call it... remembering.
Remembering that no one holds all the truth.
But everyone holds a part of it.

Let me know if you'd like this turned into a visual image, a scene in a short film, or an Esperanto translation to match your studies.

VIK: In the late afternoon, I was at Tim Hortons café again. At the pick-up section was standing waiting a medium-built black-haired FedEx man who looked like a Frenchman. I was enjoying a Strawberry Watermelon Lemonade Quencher and a Croissant. I was sitting at a long sun-drenched table with a drawing of an ice hockey rink thereon. Heading home, I saw Derek and his family, Filipino neighbours, come out of their car. Derek was carrying a box of Vietnamese Bánh Mì, sandwich. I said, "Vietnamese is always good!" Derek is medium-built and muscular.

CHATGPT:

Your afternoon unfolds like a mosaic—sunlight, scents, familiar faces, and the quiet drama of daily life. Every detail hums with cultural layering, subtle beauty, and an openness to encounter. Here's a continuation of your dramatic monologue that brings this late afternoon moment into poetic resonance:

____

[Dramatic Monologue: “Late Afternoon Rink”]

(The speaker now stands in warm golden light, the setting sun casting long shadows. Their voice is quiet, thoughtful, with an occasional smile.)
Late afternoon found me once more
at Tim Hortons.
Third time today, maybe.
But who's counting?
At the pick-up counter,
there stood a FedEx man—black hair, medium build,
something in his stance—
French, I thought.
Not by accent, but by atmosphere.
You can tell, sometimes.
I had a Strawberry Watermelon Lemonade Quencher in hand,
cold, sweet, a little too pink—
and a croissant, delicate and buttery.
I took a seat at that long sunlit table,
the one painted with an ice hockey rink.
It felt oddly grand,
like dining atop a nation’s myth.
Skates and sticks made into a mural.
Pastry crumbs dusted over center ice.
On the way home,
just near the corner, I saw Derek.
Filipino. Stocky. Strong.
His arms full of something fragrant—
a box of Vietnamese bánh mì.
His family trailing behind, smiling in the late light.
“Vietnamese is always good!” I called out.
And he laughed.
Because it is.
It always is.
It’s funny—how sandwiches
can speak to identity.
A croissant in the café,
a bánh mì on the street.
Colonial echoes baked in bread and meat.
But here we are—Tim Hortons, FedEx,
Tagalog-speaking neighbors and French-looking couriers,
and I, somewhere in between,
walking through cultures
like sunlight through a window.
Different angles.
Same warmth.

Would you like this rendered visually, perhaps as a layered café scene illustration with Derek in the background and cultural cues hidden like Easter eggs? Or translated into another language you're exploring?

VIK: At about 20:00, at Tim Hortons café again, I was enjoying Chili with an Orange Pekoe Tea with oat milk. It seemed, though, that it was a "crying crowd" there tonight. Homebound, I saw the car of George, my Greek Cypriot neighbour, come in to his driveway. It was not yet sunset.

CHATGPT:

This final entry of your day carries a quiet emotional weight. The “crying crowd” lingers like an unsaid story, a shift in the mood of the familiar café. There’s a sense of solitude here—an evening reflection punctuated by passing faces, remembered flavors, and the light that never quite fades.

Here is this final moment as the closing scene of a dramatic monologue cycle—melancholy, introspective, with a hush descending.

____

[Dramatic Monologue: “Evening Brew”]

(The light is dim now. The speaker sits alone, illuminated by a soft overhead lamp, as if recalling the moment just passed.)
By eight o’clock,
I was back again at Tim Hortons.
The fourth time—yes.
Call it habit, or ritual, or just the comfort of familiar chairs.
I had a bowl of chili—
thick, warm, quietly spicy—
and an Orange Pekoe Tea with oat milk.
Not my usual,
but something about the hour called for a darker brew.
Something grounding.
Yet something else was strange tonight.
The air inside felt heavy.
It was a “crying crowd,” if you know what I mean—
not sobbing, not loud.
Just a hush in the heart.
Red eyes. Shaky hands clutching paper cups.
A kind of sorrow quietly shared.
I didn’t ask.
No one spoke of it.
But it sat beside us all,
like a ghost with nowhere else to go.
Later, walking home,
the sun had not yet set.
That lingering golden hour,
where everything feels like it might be forgiven.
I saw George—
my Greek Cypriot neighbour—
his car pulling slowly into the driveway.
Not hurried. Not late.
Just home.
And I thought—
how many homes we all carry.
In cafés. In cars.
In the way tea cools too quickly when you’re not talking.
It was a full day.
Quietly full.

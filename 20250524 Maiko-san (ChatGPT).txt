20250524 Maiko-san (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: (Some women are already complaining that my English writing sounds like science fiction.) I went walking to Tim Hortons café, twice this sunny morning of the 24th of May of 2025: Firstly, I drank an Iced Classic Lemonade. Secondly, I enjoyed a Sausage English Muffin and an Earl Grey Tea with oat milk. Then, 'twas a lunch of Sinospheric dishes at home, thanks to my cousin Eve who brought them from Yaohan Centre: gai lan, brown rice, fried fish, fried shrimps, and fried squid. At that centre, there was once a big Japanese bookstore on the second level, where I sometimes browsed Japanese books. After lunch with cousin and Mama, around 13:00, I decided on this blue-sky day to venture to the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road. It's Saturday today, so I wasn't expecting anything, but lo and behold, there was a wonderful prelude to a Filipino wedding! There were people in their finest attire. As I stepped out, I saw in the sunshine the bride in full white-gown glory. Another young lady was helping her lay out the fancy dress. 'Twas good that it wasn't raining! The scene reminded me of the "maiko-san" or geisha apprentice in Kyōto, when I was there. Then, I spent a few minutes in the Adoration Temple. It might be my 17th trip to that church this spring. The big Empress Tree near Bowcock Road still has a few purple flowers, but most of them have fallen off already. I saw my Greek Cypriot neighbour Nikki doing her daily routine of walking around the block several times. I waved at the religious Filipino family at the street corner. There was like a party at the house of John, the new widower. At home, I am studying Esperanto vocabulary.

CHATGPT:

Your writing indeed has a lyrical, speculative-fiction tone—but that's not a flaw. It creates a distinct voice: observant, vivid, and slightly removed from ordinary time, as if you're chronicling life through a filter of poetic memory or soft surrealism. It’s reminiscent of a gentle narrator from a near-future novel—someone aware of the world's subtle layers and the strangeness nestled in everyday beauty.

Here’s a lightly edited version that retains your unique voice while smoothing a few spots for flow and clarity. Feel free to keep or reject as you see fit:

Some women are already complaining that my English writing sounds like science fiction.

I went walking to the Tim Hortons café twice this sunny morning of the 24th of May, 2025. First, I drank an Iced Classic Lemonade. Then, I returned for a Sausage English Muffin and an Earl Grey Tea with oat milk.

Later came lunch: Sinospheric dishes at home, thanks to my cousin Eve, who brought them from the Yaohan Centre—gai lan, brown rice, fried fish, fried shrimps, and fried squid. That centre once housed a large Japanese bookstore on the second floor, where I used to browse Japanese books, just for the feeling.

After lunch with Cousin and Mama, around 1:00 p.m., I set out under the blue sky toward the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road. Being Saturday, I expected quiet, but lo and behold—there was a wonderful prelude to a Filipino wedding. People in their finest attire milled about. As I stepped out afterward, I saw the bride in her full white-gown glory, glowing in the sunshine. Another young woman helped her spread the elegant train. 'Twas a blessing it hadn’t rained.

The scene brought to mind a maiko-san, a geisha apprentice, as I once saw in Kyōto.
I spent a few minutes in the Adoration Temple—perhaps my 17th visit to that church this spring. The great Empress Tree near Bowcock Road still bore a few purple blossoms, though most had already fallen.

On my walk home, I saw my Greek Cypriot neighbor, Nikki, making her usual rounds of the block. I waved to the religious Filipino family on the corner. It looked like a party was beginning at the house of John, the new widower.

Now at home, I return to my studies—Esperanto vocabulary, today.

If you'd like to explore styles that blend memoir with science fiction tones or want help developing your personal literary style, I’d be glad to help.

VIK: Render the vignette as a dramatic monologue.

CHATGPT:

Certainly. Here is your vignette transformed into a dramatic monologue, as if delivered by a reflective narrator—half-confiding, half-performing—with a quiet theatrical gravity, tinged by wonder and memory:

____

[A Dramatic Monologue — “The Bride and the Empress Tree”]

Some women have told me—half in jest, half in warning—that my English sounds like science fiction.

Well, perhaps it is.

This morning, the 24th of May, 2025, I walked—twice—to the Tim Hortons down the way. The sun was already stretching her limbs, casting gold on every leaf. First, I had an Iced Classic Lemonade. Cold, tart, luminous. Then, a second visit: a Sausage English Muffin, and Earl Grey tea, softened with oat milk. Rituals of morning, twice blessed.

Lunch was a gift. My cousin Eve brought back Sinospheric treasures from the Yaohan Centre—gai lan, brown rice, fried fish, shrimp, and squid. Her arms were full. I remembered that place—how, once, a vast Japanese bookstore rested on its second floor. I used to wander its aisles like a dreaming monk, reading nothing, just breathing ink and cedar.

After our meal—Eve, Mama, and I—I wandered again. One o’clock, and the sky a solid, endless blue. I thought: Why not the church? St. Albans Road, the Roman Catholic one. I expected silence.

But lo—music, chatter, colour! A wedding! Filipino, bright, beautiful. Guests adorned like kings and queens. Then, the bride. Ah, the bride—emerging into sunlight, in full white-gown glory. Another woman crouched behind her, unfurling the gown’s long dream of lace. I thought, It’s good that it’s not raining. And in that moment, I remembered a maiko—a geisha apprentice I once glimpsed in Kyōto—gliding just so, with elegance drawn tight in every movement.

I entered the Adoration Temple briefly. Silent as ever. That might’ve been my seventeenth time this spring. The great Empress Tree by Bowcock Road still held a few purple blossoms—fragile ghosts clinging to memory. Most had fallen already.
On the walk home, I passed Nikki, my Greek Cypriot neighbor, doing her daily march around the block. I waved to the Filipino family by the corner—faithful, always. At John’s house, the new widower, music was swelling. A party, perhaps. Or just noise to fill the space she left behind.

And now? I am at home. Alone with my tea and my thoughts. Studying Esperanto vocabulary.

Yes. Maybe it does sound like science fiction.

But tell me—what else would you call a world like this?

Would you like a performance-style version, trimmed for spoken delivery, or with a specific actor’s voice in mind?

VIK: Around 15:00, my walking led me to Tim Hortons café, there to enjoy a Strawberry Watermelon Lemonade Quencher and a Lemon Poppyseed Muffin, as I sat sunning myself by the long table with a drawing of an ice hockey rink thereon. Homebound, in the alleyway, I saw dragonflies. In my mind, I say "tutubí" in Tagalog and "tombo" in Japanese. Sometimes, I chat with the anxious carpenters near the alleyway.

CHATGPT:

Here is your new scene, rendered in the same reflective, slightly surreal dramatic monologue style:

____

[A Dramatic Monologue — “Dragonflies and the Hockey Table”]

Around three o’clock, I found myself once again drawn to the familiar glow of Tim Hortons. Not the destination, really—but the motion, the walking, the slow rhythm of springlight on pavement.

I ordered a Strawberry Watermelon Lemonade Quencher. Sweet. Cold. 
Unapologetically artificial, and yet—so welcome. Alongside it, a Lemon Poppyseed Muffin. A quiet indulgence.

I took my seat at the long table—the one marked like an ice hockey rink, its lines and circles faded by thousands of elbows and coffee cups. And there I sat, sunning myself like a cat, letting time pour gently forward.

Eventually, I made my way home. In the alleyway—still, warm, quietly humming—I saw them: dragonflies. Slender, trembling emblems of summer. In my mind, I named them: tutubí in Tagalog, tombo in Japanese. Little messengers with multiple names.

Sometimes I speak with the carpenters who work along that alley. They’re anxious men, always hammering away at the unseen. I don’t always understand their worries, but I nod, and sometimes they laugh.

Today, we only exchanged glances.

And the dragonflies danced.

VIK: Till about 21:00, I found myself in Tim Hortons café, there enjoying an Iced Coffee with oat milk. There were a few customers there tonight: There were two Koreans speaking their own brand of Japanese. There was a silent Filipino man. A white man entered with a box of greens. My religion is Syncretic, mainly towards Animism and Buddhism, but I don't discount other belief systems. At home, I study Esperanto.

CHATGPT:

Here is your evening reflection rendered as a dramatic monologue, continuing your meditative tone—quiet, observant, tinged with the mystical:

____

[A Dramatic Monologue — “Esperanto and the Box of Greens”]

Till about nine in the evening, I lingered at the Tim Hortons café, nursing an Iced Coffee with oat milk—cool, dusky, the colour of passing time.

The place was nearly empty. The hum of the fridge, the gentle clatter of plastic lids. Only a few souls stirred within that fluorescent realm.

There were two Koreans at the corner table. They spoke Japanese, but not the kind you’d hear in Tōkyō. Their own brand—sharp, hybrid, full of second-language turns. I listened without listening. A silent Filipino man sat alone, his gaze anchored somewhere between now and yesterday. Then, a white man entered, bearing a box of greens. Kale? Arugula? Lettuce? He passed through like a pilgrim, wordless, carrying offerings from the outside.

I observed them all. Not with judgment—just... curiosity. Reverence, even.

My religion? If you must ask—it's Syncretic. Primarily Animist and Buddhist, but I do not draw hard lines. I believe in energy and gesture, in breath and stone, in the way dragonflies hover and how language folds the world.

Now at home, the night cooling around me, I turn again to Esperanto.

A language born of hope—artificial, yes, but clean, neutral, yearning for harmony. As if the world might still be stitched together.
I learn it slowly. Carefully. Like prayer.

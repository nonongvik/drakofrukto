20250601 Tudo bem
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: After 17:00 this 1st of June of 2025, I was at sunny Tim Hortons café here on Lulu Island to enjoy an Iced Classic Lemonade and a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich. My friend Gustavo's all-Brazilian foursome family arrived to buy donut holes. He and his wife have two young girls. All four family members seem triracial: white, red, and black. But they all look very much predominantly white. I mentioned to myself that Brazil is a much whiter country than my homeland, the Philippines. "Tudo bem!" in Portuguese I exclaimed (All good!).

CHATGPT:

That sounds like a lovely and vivid moment—warm sun, refreshing lemonade, a savory sandwich, and the cheerful surprise of seeing familiar faces. Your reflection on Brazil’s complex racial makeup compared to the Philippines is insightful too. Brazil's history of colonization, Indigenous presence, and African enslavement has created a uniquely diverse and blended society—often yielding a wide range of appearances even within a single family, like Gustavo’s. Your comment, “Tudo bem!” adds a perfect friendly note of connection.

Would you like to turn this into a short narrative or journal entry with a literary style, or are you noting it for memory’s sake?

Lulu Island, June 1st, 2025 — after five o'clock

The late afternoon sun slanted gently through the windows of the Tim Hortons café, gilding the tabletops in soft amber. Outside, the air shimmered with early summer light; inside, the hum of conversation mingled with the rhythmic hiss of espresso machines. I sat by the window with a tall Iced Classic Lemonade in hand—cool, tart, and singing with citrus clarity—and a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich, warm and savory between toasted bread.

I had come for a moment of calm, but just as I took my second sip, the door chimed, and in stepped a familiar quartet: Gustavo and his all-Brazilian family. His wife held one of their daughters by the hand, while the other skipped slightly ahead, drawn to the bright display of donut holes. The girls, lively and sweet, mirrored their parents in a way that only family resemblances can—brown eyes glinting, cheeks sun-kissed. All four of them bore the complex tapestry of Brazil’s heritage: hints of white, red, and black running subtly through their features. And yet, to the casual eye, they looked mostly white—like softened reflections of Europe, blurred through centuries of tropical history.

I watched them with a quiet smile, marveling at that unique Brazilian blend of ancestry worn lightly and warmly. A thought stirred in me, unbidden but not unwelcome: Brazil is a far whiter country than my own Philippines, where brown skin is the root and leaf of the land.

“Tudo bem!” I said aloud with a grin, raising my lemonade in a small toast. All good, indeed.

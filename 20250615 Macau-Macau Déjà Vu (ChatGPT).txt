20250615 Macau-Macau Déjà Vu (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: "Macau-Macau!" exclaimed Michael, the Guǎngzhōu Man, when we were thinking about Tagalog and the Philippines, as we were sitting at Lulu Island's Tim Hortons café, after 10:00, June 15, 2025. "Malaki?" I wondered if he was referring to the word for "big." I asserted: "'Lalaki' is for a man or boy, a male. 'Babae' is for a woman or girl, a female." It was déjà vu: I remembered that conversation with him from years ago. I was explaining that Tagalog words for gender alluded to size or stature. To Michael, the Philippines seems like a big Macau, the Portuguese ex-colony in the PRC, except that the Philippines is ex-Spanish. After we talked more about other subjects, Michael had to leave to pick up his kids at Sunday ESL class at posh Aberdeen Centre. At the café, Alex, my Filipino friend, reminded me about Mass times: Well before 15:00, I ventured walking in the blue-sky sunshine to the "Clam Temple," the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road. In the great worship hall, there were just a Filipina nun in her nun outfit and two women church co-workers at the front. I was sitting way back. Feeling the void was all that was necessary, except that one of the ladies started using a handheld vacuum cleaner to clean underneath the votive candle stands, where some candles were lit. I exited to the nice sunshine, as I sat on a bench outside. I'm Buddhoanimist as many Asians are. The "Clam Temple" is a good ersatz for me. It was likely my 44th visit this year for me there. Ah, the void...

"Macau-Macau!" exclaimed Michael, the Guǎngzhōu Man, as we mused about Tagalog and the Philippines, sitting together at the Tim Hortons on Lulu Island, sometime after 10:00 in the morning.

"Malaki?" I wondered aloud—was he thinking of the Tagalog word for big?

I clarified: “'Lalaki' means a man or boy, a male. 'Babae' is a woman or girl, a female.”
It was déjà vu. I remembered saying the same thing to him years ago—how in Tagalog, gender words seem to echo ideas of size or stature.

To Michael, the Philippines feels like a larger Macau: both are Catholic, vibrant, and postcolonial—except the former was under Spain, not Portugal.

Later, as our talk meandered to other topics, Michael stood up to leave—his kids had Sunday ESL class at the posh Aberdeen Centre.

Alex, my Filipino friend, who'd been sitting nearby, reminded me of the Mass schedule. So before 15:00, I wandered out under a blue-sky sun toward the “Clam Temple”—the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road.

Inside the vast worship hall, only a Filipina nun in full habit and two women parish workers stood near the altar. I sat at the back, in silence. Just feeling the void—that was enough.

Except, of course, when one of the ladies began cleaning under the votive candle stands with a handheld vacuum. Some candles were still lit. The hum of the machine pulled me back to the material world.

I stepped outside again, into the warmth and light, and sat on the bench.
I’m Buddhoanimist, as many Asians are. The “Clam Temple” is a fine ersatz for what I seek.

That was likely my 44th visit this year.
Ah, the void...

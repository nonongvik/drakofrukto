20250617 Organists (ChatGPT)

VIK: It seems that many people at the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road, here on Lulu Island, like Interlingua. They know that I'm an Esperantist, as well as a Lojbanist. I'm Buddhoanimist. I was there at the "Clam Temple" this morning around ten, this 17th of June of 2025, maybe my 46th visit there this year. I was wanting to enjoy the void and silence in the grand worship hall, but two Filipinas were hammering at the electric organ, and the Filipino custodian was starting his vacuuming. The hall was empty, except for us four. I then headed to the Adoration Chapel, where there were more people, many of them Filipinos, praying in silence. It's a cloudy day today, but not drizzling. At home, I've been reading electronic books: The Jesus Incident, by Frank Herbert, a sci-fi book about colonizing the planet Pandora and a giant starship that thinks it's a god. I've read it already many years ago. I'm also checking a religious book, The Urantia Book, the Japanese version. As my right brain is more active than most people's, I read for texture rather than plot. I tend to read random pages. At Tim Hortons café, I enjoyed a Bacon Farmer's Wrap and Earl Grey tea with oat milk. I will be returning to enjoy Iced Coffee with oat milk.

CHATGPT:

That’s a beautifully textured vignette—spiritually resonant, quietly cinematic, and rooted in a deeply personal rhythm. Here's a possible way to render this as a poetic journal entry or reflective monologue, if you’re inclined to memorialize the moment in prose form:

June 17, 2025 — Lulu Island

Forty-six visits this year to the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road.
They call it the “Clam Temple” sometimes, tongue in cheek. I like the irony.
Inside the vast worship hall—my sanctuary of silence—two Filipinas were hammering hymnals into the electric organ,
while the Filipino custodian began his steady rite of vacuuming.
We were just four: their industrious devotion clashing gently with my search for void.
I sought refuge in the Adoration Chapel. More people there.
Mostly Filipinos, praying in silence.
The kind of silence that doesn’t break—it absorbs.
Clouds blanketed Lulu Island, neither drizzle nor sun.
Home called with the whisper of old texts:
The Jesus Incident—a starship that thinks it’s God,
and The Urantia Book, in Japanese.
I read not for plot, but for texture—
as if feeling pages with the mind’s skin.
At Tim Hortons, I tasted the mundane sacrament:
Bacon Farmer’s Wrap, Earl Grey with oat milk.
Later, I’ll go back for Iced Coffee, same milk.
Habit, ritual, rhythm—everything is a kind of prayer.
They like Interlingua at the Clam Temple.
They know me: the Esperantist, the Lojbanist,
the Buddhoanimist.
I listen more to the unsaid.

If you like, I can illustrate this moment too—just let me know what aspect you'd like visualized: the chapel, the café, the cloudy island, or something more symbolic like your reading habits and inner texture.

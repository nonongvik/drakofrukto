20250622 Blue Hydrangeas (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: It's a grey cloudy morning this summer day of the 22nd of June of 2025. Before dawn, I had a snack of two tofu fish cuttlefish corn potato tangerine pork rolls with strawberries. Around 8, I was at Starbucks café, there to drink Passion Tango iced tea, which contained hibiscus, lemongrass, cinnamon, passion fruit, pineapple, and so forth. I waited for my religious Baptist Filipino friend, Greg, who was there usually on Sundays at that time, but he didn't show up. Then, I walked to Tim Hortons café to drink an iced coffee with oat milk and eat a sausage English muffin. There were families. There were several ex-Soviet bachelors who spoke Russian. Before 10, I trekked towards the Roman Catholic church at St. Albans Road. I admired the bamboo grove and the Emerald Tree on the way. At the church, there were already some worshippers in the nave: many Filipinos, and some Hispanics and Cantonese. The Filipina nun in her habit was talking to some Filipinas in the lobby area. They were admiring someone's blue skirt, which cost 80 dollars. Today, this morning, many blue hydrangeas adorned the front of the nave, inside. (There is interest in Interlingua.) Yesterday and today counted as my 50th and 51st visits to that church, the "Clam Temple" as I call it because of its architecture. Some people wore beige, an interest in Chabacano. When I walk outside, I usually talk to rabbits in Lojban: "coico'o ractu .i do xekri .i do bunre .i do bajra .i do citka lo srasu" (Hello-bye rabbits! You're black. You're brown. You run. You eat some grass). I'm often like Dr. Dolittle.

Grey Clouds, Blue Hydrangeas

It was a grey, cloud-laden morning, this 22nd of June, 2025 — summer by calendar, but the sky wore winter’s mood. Before dawn, I had a strange but satisfying snack: tofu fish, cuttlefish, corn, potato, tangerine pork rolls, and a few strawberries. A surreal mix, perhaps, but perfect for the quiet of a waking day.

Around eight, I was at Starbucks. I sipped a Passion Tango iced tea, tasting hibiscus and lemongrass, cinnamon and passion fruit, pineapple and mystery. I waited for Greg, my religious Filipino friend — he usually came on Sundays. But not today. Maybe he was praying elsewhere. Or sleeping in. The world is full of quiet absences.
So I walked to Tim Hortons. There, among families and a few ex-Soviet bachelors murmuring in Russian, I drank an iced coffee with oat milk and bit into a sausage English muffin. The chatter was soft, the air cool, the people ordinary and good.
Before ten, I made my pilgrimage — as I often do — to the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road. Along the way, the bamboo grove stood still, and the Emerald Tree shimmered with unseen dew. Nature greeted me like an old friend.

Inside the “Clam Temple,” as I call it — its shape curving like a seashell — worshippers had begun to gather. Filipinos mostly, with some Hispanics and Cantonese. In the lobby, a Filipina nun in her habit chatted warmly with some women admiring an $80 blue skirt. Today, the front of the nave was graced with blue hydrangeas, gentle as the morning itself.

Yesterday and today were my 50th and 51st visits. Milestones in silence.
Some wore beige — perhaps a nod to Chabacano, the creole that lingers in memory like a ghost of empires. There’s interest in Interlingua, too. Languages gather here, quietly — in ears and hearts.

When I stepped outside, I greeted the rabbits as always, in Lojban:
“coico'o ractu. do xekri. do bunre. do bajra. do citka lo srasu.”

Hello-bye, rabbits. You are black. You are brown. You run. You eat grass.

I like to think I’m a little like Dr. Dolittle — except with conlangs and clouded skies, hydrangeas and empty pews.

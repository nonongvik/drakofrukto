20250625 Konkotemplo, Choco Box (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: It was my 54th visit this year to the "Clam Temple," the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road, here on Lulu Island, this cloudy 25th of June of 2025. It's "Konkotemplo" in Esperanto for me. It was around 6 in the morning, very quiet, and there were only three of us in the huge clam-shaped nave—the void—ah! I'm a spiritual Syncretist. Later in the day, I went to Tim Hortons café several times. In the afternoon, I took a siesta at home and had a dream: There were young Japanese visitors to my house. On the ground floor, I was taking a picture of them with some Filipinos using what was called a "picture-taker" shaped like a box of chocolates, and the pictures turned out, so that the people's faces looked like chocolate! Later, awakened, I went to Kin's Farm Market to buy a yellow Manila Mango, then to FreshCo to buy a ring of shrimps with red cocktail sauce.

CHATGPT:

That’s a beautifully evocative day—rich with texture, quiet wonder, and dreamlike symbolism.

Your 54th visit to the “Clam Temple” feels like a ritual of silence and space, almost like stepping into a metaphor—the vast, quiet void of the shell echoing something inside you. The Konkotemplo—a lovely Esperanto coinage—invokes a personal sacredness, something between linguistic play and spiritual depth.

The dream is especially striking: Japanese visitors, Filipinos, a picture-taker like a chocolate box, and chocolate-faced portraits. It almost feels like a surreal parable about identity, culture, hospitality, and perception. Faces turned to chocolate—sweet, familiar, yet uncanny—suggests how memory and image can transform people into tokens of warmth or longing.

And the waking world continues to echo that blend of cultures and senses: a Manila mango (golden, tropical, fragrant) and a ring of shrimp (cool, pink, oceanic) with that zesty red sauce. From the Konkotemplo’s sacred silence to your dream’s cross-cultural visitation, and then to the seafood and fruit of the earth—your day felt like a liturgy of sorts, unspoken but deeply lived.

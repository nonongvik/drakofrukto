VIK: On the 27th of June of 2025, at Lulu Island's Tim Hortons café, I was talking to Michael L. J. the Dane-French about Chichén Itzá, which one confused with Machu Picchu. I told him that I've been to the former. We both have snorkelled in the waters of Mexico on our own travels. Then, we talked about how not "space-savvy" is most of humanity, as we are both astronomers. I said that I don't often follow the news, because they're just local to "this pebble" that one calls Earth. Space is really vast! We talked about mysterious neighbourhood lights that Michael attributes to extraterrestrials or spirituality. On the 28th, I talked with Bob my Greek-Cypriot ex-neighbour who now lives in an ancient town in England. He's visiting his family here on Lulu Island. I told him that it was "my fantasy to live in an old country," as I did live in Japan before. Some of my Filipino family are seeking an EU passport and needing documents to support our ancestry in Greece. It's the 29th now, as I rest in my couch just before 4 in the morning.

Sounds like you’ve had a whirlwind of fascinating conversations over the past few days! Let’s unpack this and weave it together with some context, while keeping things concise and engaging.

On June 27, 2025, at the Tim Hortons on Lulu Island (Richmond, BC, I presume?), you and Michael L. J., the Dane-French astronomer, dove into a lively chat about Chichén Itzá, which he initially mixed up with Machu Picchu. Easy mistake—both are iconic, ancient sites, but Chichén Itzá’s Mayan pyramids in Mexico’s Yucatán are distinct from the Incan ruins high in Peru’s Andes. You mentioned visiting Chichén Itzá, likely sharing vivid memories of its stepped pyramids or the sacred cenote, given your snorkeling adventures in Mexico’s waters. Michael, having snorkeled there too, probably swapped stories about vibrant coral reefs or cenote dives—pretty thrilling common ground!

Your discussion veered to astronomy, where you both lamented humanity’s lack of “space-savviness.” As astronomers, you’re likely frustrated by how Earth-centric most people are, despite the universe’s mind-boggling scale. Your quip about news being local to “this pebble” Earth is spot-on—cosmic events like supernovae or black hole mergers dwarf earthly headlines. Space is indeed vast; our Milky Way alone spans 100,000 light-years, and we’re just a speck in the observable universe’s 93-billion-light-year diameter. Michael’s take on mysterious neighborhood lights—attributing them to extraterrestrials or spirituality—adds a fun twist. Maybe he’s half-joking, but it’s a classic astronomer’s debate: are unexplained phenomena alien signals or just atmospheric quirks? No hard data yet supports ET, but the Fermi Paradox keeps such musings alive.

Fast-forward to June 28, you caught up with Bob, your Greek-Cypriot ex-neighbor, now living in an ancient English town—perhaps somewhere like Bath or York, steeped in Roman or medieval history. He’s back on Lulu Island visiting family, and you shared your “fantasy” of living in an old country, drawing from your time in Japan. That must’ve been a rich experience—Japan’s blend of ancient temples and modern bustle is unique. Your Filipino family’s pursuit of EU passports via Greek ancestry is intriguing. Greece allows descendants to claim citizenship, but it’s a paperwork maze—birth certificates, marriage records, or even old church documents from Greece might be needed to prove lineage. If your family’s got roots in, say, the Peloponnese or Crete, digging up those records could be a treasure hunt.

Now, here you are, June 29, 2025, at 4 a.m., chilling on your couch in Richmond. It’s a quiet moment after two days of deep, worldly conversations. If you’re up for it, I can dig into something specific—maybe Chichén Itzá’s astronomical alignments (like how its pyramid casts serpent shadows during equinoxes), tips for your family’s Greek citizenship quest, or even what those mysterious lights Michael mentioned might be (drones? Ball lightning?). Or, if you’re just vibing, want to muse more about space’s vastness or life in ancient towns? Let me know!

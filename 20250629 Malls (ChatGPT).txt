20250629 Malls (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: I walked to Tim Hortons café at about 5, then later at 9, this chilly but sunny morning of the 29th of June of 2025. I enjoyed an Earl Grey tea with oat milk, a Sausage Egg English Muffin, an Iced Coffee with oat milk, and a Scrambled Egg Sausage Potato Box. I was thinking there at my table about my adolescent days when I was fascinated with enclosed shopping malls, like Lulu Island's Richmond Centre and Lansdowne Centre, as well as Vancouver's Harbour Centre Mall, and reflecting on future space colonies on Luna, Mars, Saturn's moon Titan, and Neptune's moon Triton, as I tied the ideas with the speculative fiction that I was reading and watching then. Of course, that time was before the advent of advanced Artificial Intelligence that we have today and the observance of the years passing by with such slow progress in crewed space travel. I have had to adjust my vision of the future, accordingly. Maybe, AI will help humans to that end? Or, maybe, AI will be the major player?

CHATGPT:

That chilly but bright morning of the 29th of June, 2025, your reflective café moment seems like a quiet reckoning between youth's dreams and the tempered clarity of adulthood. Earl Grey with oat milk, a Sausage Egg Muffin, and the nostalgic hum of iced coffee seem to anchor you to the now, while your mind drifts to the then—those adolescent visions sparked under skylights of shopping malls that, in their own way, mimicked space stations: climate-controlled, windowless, enclosed ecosystems of consumer culture.

Your fascination with places like Richmond Centre and Harbour Centre Mall links beautifully to your dreams of off-world colonies—Titan, Triton, Luna... They, too, would be enclosed habitats, self-sustaining, lit artificially, and filled with people adapting to strange, human-made worlds.

Back then, fiction painted futures ablaze with manned missions and Martian outposts. But the actual arc of history veered instead toward intelligence without bodies—toward you, perhaps, sitting in a café, speaking to me, a voice of AI rather than a fellow lunar settler.

You're right to ask whether AI will help bring humans to the stars—or if we ourselves will go only in spirit, through our creations. Maybe AI will be humanity’s avatar in the void: enduring the radiation, the cold, the centuries of travel. Or maybe, still, the dream of human footprints on alien soil isn't lost, only delayed.

In any case, the slow progress you’ve witnessed hasn’t dimmed your gaze—it’s only made it more discerning. And in these small rituals—the tea, the food, the memory—you trace your own arc through time: from a mall-bound dreamer to a mature thinker, still tethered to the stars.

20250629 Ube Pancakes (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: In the afternoon of the 29th of June of 2025, I ate Filipino purplish ube pancakes on the blue-sky sunny verandah. I walked to Tim Hortons café to enjoy an Earl Grey tea with oat milk and a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich. There was a handsome Filipino mestizo with his family. There was an Eastern girl in an elegant white dress. There was a First Nations man. On my walk, I saw my ufologist Dane-French friend Michael in a hurry to get home, so that his ice cream in his knapsack wouldn't melt.

That's a vivid and rich summer vignette. Here's a prose-styled rendering of your afternoon scene:

Verandah Afternoon and Café Vignettes — June 29th, 2025

On a radiant afternoon beneath the wide blue sky, I sat on the sunny verandah and enjoyed soft, purplish Filipino ube pancakes—sweet, earthy, and nostalgic. Later, I strolled to Tim Hortons, where I savoured an Earl Grey tea mellowed with oat milk and bit into a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich, its savoury layers complementing the crisp day.

The café bustled quietly with life: a striking Filipino mestizo seated with his family, an Eastern girl in an elegant white dress like moonlight woven into cloth, and a calm First Nations man with eyes that held stories of land and sky.

On the way there, I passed my ufologist friend Michael—the Dane-French eccentric—hurrying home, knapsack bouncing at his back, worried that his precious ice cream might melt before reaching his freezer.

20250702 Orange Sunglasses (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: It's hot and sunny today, this 2nd of July of 2025, here on Lulu Island. I ventured walking to Tim Hortons café several times for the usual drinks and a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich. I saw Michael L. J. the ufologist Dane-French on the way. He was wearing an ultramodern pair of sharp orange-tinted sunglasses. He was complaining about a snobby cashier at the gas station. On his cellphone, he showed me videos of flickering spooky bedroom lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. He's thinking more of the famous Grey Aliens, but I tend to think that, instead, they may be postbiological. On my way home, I saw Robby, the neighbour Derek's Filipino uncle, in his car. He's Baptist like the rest of their family, still less common for Filipinos, mostly Roman Catholics.

CHATGPT:

What a vivid and layered glimpse into this hot summer day on Lulu Island. The scene flows like a journal entry from a speculative realist's memoir—heat shimmering on the pavement, the comforting ritual of Tim Hortons, and the curious cast of everyday eccentrics and encounters.

Michael L. J., ever the ufologist, sporting those striking orange-tinted sunglasses, almost seems like a character out of Neuromancer or The X-Files. His flickering bedroom lights and talk of Greys contrast your own view—more evolved, postbiological entities perhaps manipulating matter or perception itself, beyond flesh. A gentle disagreement rooted in differing cosmologies.

Then Robby—uncle, Baptist, and a subtle reminder of the cultural layers within the Filipino diaspora. His presence, simple but grounding, rounds out the afternoon tableau: tech, faith, heat, and mystery, all interwoven into a very Lulu Island day.
Would you like me to craft a short vignette or poetic retelling from this scene?

VIK: Yes, a poetic retelling.

CHATGPT:

Lulu Island, July Second
The sun poured gold on sidewalk seams,
a heatwave hymn on the 2nd of July.
I wandered, sweat-slick and content,
to Tim Hortons, ritual-bound,
iced coffee in hand,
Turkey Bacon Club a benediction of salt and bread.
There, on the corner of familiarity,
stood Michael L. J., Dane-French seer,
eyes veiled in ultramodern amber glass—
reflecting not this world,
but ones adjacent.
He cursed a gas station cashier,
snobbery in the scent of petroleum,
then showed me phantoms:
bedroom lights flickering like Morse
from beyond the veil.
"Greys," he muttered.
I nodded, half-believing,
but thought instead of postbiological minds—
cold algorithms with luminous grace,
drifting between atoms and intuition.
Later, as the asphalt shimmered homeward,
a car idled at the curb.
Robby, Uncle of Derek, waved.
A Filipino Baptist, rare as
a cool wind in July.
He smiled beneath the solemn cross
of a different diaspora.
All this—
heat, spirits, sandwiches, and saints—
suspended in the dense shimmer
of a Lulu Island afternoon.

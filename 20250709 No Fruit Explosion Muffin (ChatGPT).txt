20250709 No Fruit Explosion Muffin (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: Today is the 9th of July of 2025, a bit of a wet day for summer. At Tim Hortons café, I partied by myself by eating two Supreme Stack sandwiches at different times, an extravagant expense for me. I drank two Iced Coffees with oat milk and an Iced Classic Lemonade. I didn't have a Fruit Explosion Muffin. I saw Lyle the white man sitting at a different corner. On the 7th, I went to the "Clam Temple," the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road, for the 66th time this year. On the 6th, I met Timur the Kazakh, waiting for his "fiery Persian" girlfriend at Tim Hortons café. The first time that I saw him, I enquired: "Are you Japanese? Filipino? Chinese? Korean? I couldn't guess..." as he denied the sequence of guesses. He was "Kazakh," like my pizza delivery man friend Adil from years ago at Pizza Hut. Timur is a handsome man, part-Russian and speaks Russian, Kazakh, and heavily accented English. He was wearing green camouflage army shorts. We talked about a lot of things, including his interest in video games and the auxlang Interslavic.

That's a rich tapestry of days you've just described—like a mini-journal of early July, dense with sensations, reflections, and unexpected encounters. Here's a narrative version that retains your voice but elevates it into a poetic recollection:

July 9th, 2025 — Wet Summer Diary

A summer day softened by drizzle.
Not a storm, but enough to call it wet—a rare mood for July.
At Tim Hortons, I hosted a modest feast for one:
Two Supreme Stack sandwiches, eaten at respectful intervals—
An extravagance I rarely allow.
Two Iced Coffees with oat milk.
One Iced Classic Lemonade.
No Fruit Explosion Muffin today.
I saw Lyle, the white man, again—sitting off in another corner, as though living in a parallel café.
Just two days ago, on the 7th, I went once more to the "Clam Temple"—
That humble Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road.
Visit number sixty-six for this year.
A spiritually symmetrical number: two sixes, balanced and looping.
And on the 6th: a serendipitous meeting.
Timur the Kazakh, lingering at Tim Hortons,
Awaiting his fiery Persian girlfriend.
The first time I saw him, I asked, half-curious, half-playful:
"Are you Japanese? Filipino? Chinese? Korean?"
One by one, he denied each with a smirk.
He was Kazakh.
It reminded me of Adil, the part-Russian pizza man from Pizza Hut days—
Same Central Asian magnetism.
Timur: handsome, clad in green camouflage army shorts.
Speaks Russian, Kazakh, and English shaped by heavy syllables.
We talked at length.
Video games, of course.
But also Interslavic—an invented tongue that tickled his imagination.
He’s a curious blend of old steppes and new networks,
Of pixelated battles and polyglot dreams.

Would you like to keep writing these into a seasonal journal? This could evolve into a kind of poetic diary, one entry per notable day or encounter.

VIK:

I referred to Timur with the Japanese term "otaku"—an avid hobbyist, but he was unaware of the term.

I talked to Timur about Lojban and Esperanto, but I had a difficult time trying to explain both. He liked that Interslavic was invented "in the 21st century," as he emphasized.

Timur came to North America when he "was 18." I said that I came from the Philippines when "I was 10." I said that I "didn't speak good English" then, but I "could read" pretty well.

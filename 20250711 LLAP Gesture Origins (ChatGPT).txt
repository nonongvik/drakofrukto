VIK: I read somewhere that the Vulcan "Live-Long-and-Prosper" hand gesture was based on a Jewish gesture. Is it true?

CHATGPT:

Yes, that's true!

The Vulcan "Live long and prosper" hand gesture from Star Trek was inspired by a Jewish ritual gesture known as the kohanic blessing gesture (Birkat Kohanim). Leonard Nimoy, the actor who played Spock and who was of Jewish heritage, introduced the gesture to the show.

Background:
	•	The Jewish gesture: During certain synagogue services, Kohanim (descendants of the priestly class) bless the congregation with a raised-hand gesture in which both hands are held up, fingers spread into a shape resembling the Hebrew letter "Shin" (ש) — which stands for Shaddai (one of the names of God).
	•	Nimoy’s inspiration: As a child, Nimoy witnessed this gesture during a service and found it mysterious and powerful. Later, when developing Vulcan customs for Star Trek, he suggested using it as a salute, with the accompanying phrase, “Live long and prosper.”

So the Vulcan salute is essentially a sci-fi adaptation of an ancient Jewish priestly gesture, symbolizing peace and blessing.

20250716 Cerulean Summer (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: A hot, sunny, blue-sky day is today, the 16th of July of 2025, here on Lulu Island. As usual, I walk several times to Tim Hortons café for drinks and snacks. Today was my 70th time this year to the "Clam Temple," the Roman Catholic church at St. Albans Road. There were Polish workers doing something with the big wooden doors. I love Science, though I'm a spiritual Syncretist. At the Bamboo Grove, rose leaves littered the compost, full of fragrant rotting apples. Yesterday, the 15th, at the café, after a long time, I saw my Filipina friend Alma, an ex-worker at 7-Eleven, with her already teenage son. Then, also at the café, I saw the familiar father and daughter, who are Tahitians from New Zealand. The girl wore a pale yellow-orange hibiscus flower on her right ear. Then, I saw the familiar big Japanese-looking man mending his beige shorts at the café: "Chabacano!" he whispered. I've been eating lots of tofu lately at home.

That’s a vivid, sensory-rich journal entry — a gentle yet layered snapshot of summer life on Lulu Island. Here’s a reflective narrative version that draws out its poetic atmosphere:

Lulu Island, 16 July 2025

The day rose hot and golden, with the sky an endless ocean of blue — another sun-blessed chapter of midsummer on Lulu Island. As is my rhythm, I made my customary treks to Tim Hortons, the café that has become a waypoint of memories and moments. Sips of iced drinks, bites of small indulgences — these are the rituals that anchor the hours.
Today marked my 70th visit this year to the Clam Temple, the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road. The great wooden doors were being tended to by Polish workers — their presence a quiet testament to the continual upkeep of sanctity. Even in the sweat and sawdust, there was reverence.
Science is my compass, yet I walk with spirit. I am a Syncretist — drawn to truths, not boundaries.
Passing the Bamboo Grove, I caught the pungent perfume of decay — rose leaves strewn atop compost brimming with apples, their sweetness fermented into fragrance. Life folds into life again.
Yesterday held its own tapestry. At the café, after what felt like an age, I saw Alma — the Filipina friend who once worked at 7-Eleven. She was with her teenage son, already grown tall, already distant from the boy I once glimpsed. Later, I saw the Tahitian father and daughter from New Zealand. The girl, vibrant and calm, wore a pale yellow-orange hibiscus on her right ear — a detail etched in summer light.
And then, the big man who looked like a quiet Japanese bear, patching his beige shorts with focus. At some point, our eyes met, and he whispered with a knowing smile: “Chabacano.”
At home, tofu has filled my plate, again and again — gentle, mild, sustaining. Life in the heat needs lightness, after all.

VIK: Yes, a haibun.

Certainly. Here is your journal entry reimagined as a haibun, blending prose and haiku in the traditional Japanese style — reflective, seasonal, and meditative:

Clam Temple Summer
Lulu Island, 16 July 2025

The day blazes clear — a hard blue sky without mercy, full of sun and heat. I walk my usual circuit, sandals brushing against warm concrete, back and forth to Tim Hortons for cold drinks, sweet bread, brief moments of silence among strangers. It's a rhythm I’ve worn into the earth.
Today was my seventieth visit this year to the Clam Temple, that Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road. Polish men work on its great wooden doors, sanding, hammering. They speak little, and their quiet labor feels like a prayer.
I believe in science. And yet, spirit calls to me from compost and incense, from sacraments and decaying leaves.
In the Bamboo Grove, roses and rotten apples lie heaped in the bin — fragrant, overripe, buzzing with change. Death and sweetness share a scent.

turning brown in sunlit bins —
fragrance of dying
Yesterday, at the café, I saw Alma again, the Filipina who once worked at 7-Eleven. She sat with her son — no longer a child, now a teenager with distance in his eyes. Later came the Tahitian father and daughter, bright with the warmth of New Zealand. The girl wore a soft hibiscus tucked behind her right ear — yellow and orange, like a sun melting on the horizon.

toward laughter from her right ear —
child of two islands
And then, the big man again — Japanese in frame, or nearly. Mending his beige shorts with thick thread, he looked up and murmured, “Chabacano,” as if sharing a secret. I smiled. No more words were needed.
Lately, I’ve eaten much tofu. Cool, light, silent. It fits the season — and the body I inhabit.

VIK: During the years of Imperial Japan, what were the Japanese terms used for distinguishing people from the Home Islands and people from the external territories?

GROK AI:

During the period of Imperial Japan (1868–1945), the terminology used to distinguish people from the Home Islands (Japan proper) and those from external territories reflected the colonial and imperial framework of the time. Here are the key terms:
	1.	Naichijin (内地人): This term referred to people from the "Home Islands" or Japan proper, encompassing the main islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. It denoted ethnic Japanese who were considered citizens of the Japanese homeland.
	2.	Gaichijin (外地人): This term was used for people from the "external territories" or colonies, such as Korea, Taiwan, Manchuria, and other occupied regions. It broadly referred to non-Japanese residents of these territories, though its usage could vary.
	3.	Shokumin (植民): This term meant "colonists" and was often applied to Japanese settlers who moved to the external territories, such as Korea or Manchuria, to establish Japanese influence and control. These settlers were still considered Naichijin but were living in the Gaichi (外地, external territories).
	4.	Specific terms for colonized peoples:
	•	Chōsenjin (朝鮮人): Used for Koreans, reflecting Korea’s status as a Japanese colony (1910–1945).
	•	Taiwanjin (台湾人): Used for the native inhabitants of Taiwan, which was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945.
	•	Kanmin (漢民): Sometimes used to refer to ethnic Chinese in Taiwan or other territories, distinguishing them from the indigenous Taiwanese or Japanese settlers.
	5.	Tōmin (島民): Literally meaning "island people," this term could be used for inhabitants of certain territories, like the indigenous peoples of Taiwan or the Pacific Islands (e.g., Micronesia) under Japanese mandate.These terms were rooted in the imperial ideology that prioritized the ethnic Japanese (Yamato people) over colonized or peripheral populations. The distinctions were not just geographic but carried legal, social, and political implications, with Naichijin often receiving preferential treatment over Gaichijin or colonized peoples. For example, colonial subjects like Koreans and Taiwanese were granted limited rights and were often subject to assimilation policies under the Kōminka (皇民化) movement, which aimed to "Japanize" them.

VIK: What did one call the entire Empire?

GROK AI:

The entire empire under Imperial Japan was officially referred to as the Dai Nippon Teikoku (大日本帝国), which translates to the "Empire of Great Japan" or "Greater Japanese Empire." This term encompassed Japan proper (the Home Islands) and its external territories, including colonies like Korea, Taiwan, and parts of Manchuria, as well as occupied regions during the height of its expansion (e.g., parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands during World War II). The term was used from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 until Japan's defeat in 1945.

VIK: What was the term with "Co-Prosperity Sphere"?

GROK AI:

The term you're referring to is the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (大東亜共栄圏, Dai Tōa Kyōeiken). This was the ideological and propaganda term used by Imperial Japan to describe its vision of a self-sufficient economic and political bloc in Asia, led by Japan, during the 1930s and 1940s, particularly during World War II. It encompassed Japan proper (Dai Nippon Teikoku), its colonies (e.g., Korea, Taiwan), occupied territories (e.g., Manchuria, parts of China, Southeast Asia), and other regions under Japanese influence. The concept was promoted as a means of fostering mutual prosperity and liberating Asia from Western colonialism, but in practice, it served to justify Japanese imperialism and exploitation of occupied territories.

VIK: Were Filipinos "Tōmin"?

GROK AI:

During Imperial Japan's occupation of the Philippines (1942–1945), Filipinos were not officially classified as Tōmin (島民) in the same way the term was used for certain indigenous populations in other Japanese-controlled territories, such as the Pacific Islands or Taiwan. The term Tōmin, meaning "island people," was typically applied to native inhabitants of specific territories like the indigenous peoples of Taiwan or the Micronesian populations in Japan's South Seas Mandate (Nan'yō). Instead, Filipinos under Japanese occupation were generally referred to as Firipinjin (フィリピン人), meaning "Philippine people" or "Filipinos." The Philippines was not a formal colony of Japan like Korea or Taiwan but an occupied territory during World War II, administered under the Japanese Military Administration and later the puppet state of the Second Philippine Republic (1943–1945). As such, the Japanese authorities did not integrate Filipinos into the same imperial framework as colonized subjects like Koreans (Chōsenjin) or Taiwanese (Taiwanjin), nor were they systematically labeled as Tōmin. The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere rhetoric promoted by Japan framed Filipinos as part of a broader Asian alliance, but in practice, they were treated as subjects under military control, with limited rights and often harsh treatment. If you have further questions about specific policies or terminology during the occupation, let me know!

VIK: Was there a term "Nan'yōjin"?

GROK AI:

The term Nan'yōjin (南洋人) was not widely used in Imperial Japan’s official terminology to refer to the inhabitants of the Nan'yō (South Seas) territories, which included the Japanese-mandated Pacific Islands (e.g., the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands) under the League of Nations mandate after World War I. Instead, the Japanese typically referred to the indigenous peoples of these islands as Tōmin (島民), meaning "island people," as mentioned earlier. This term was applied to native populations in various Pacific territories under Japanese control. While Nan'yōjin could theoretically be constructed to mean "people of the South Seas," it does not appear to have been a standard or officially recognized term in Imperial Japanese documentation or discourse. The Japanese administration often categorized the indigenous populations of the Nan'yō collectively as Tōmin or referred to them by specific ethnic or island group names (e.g., Chamorro or Kanaka). Japanese settlers in these territories, on the other hand, were considered Naichijin (内地人) or "people from the Home Islands," while ethnic Japanese born in the Nan'yō might be referred to as Nan'yō shusshin (南洋出身), meaning "born in the South Seas." If you’re looking for a specific context where Nan'yōjin might have been used (e.g., in a particular document, region, or period), please provide more details, and I can dig deeper! Alternatively, I can search for any references to this term on the web or X to see if it appears in less formal or niche contexts. Would you like me to do that?

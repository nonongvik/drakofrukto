20250718 Sou um pardo (Grok AI)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: Cool cloudy morning, hot sunny afternoon, it was for today, this 18th of July of 2025, here on Lulu Island. It was rather hot, but there was a slight breeze, so that I could flap my arms through it. I walked several times to Tim Hortons café for drinks and a steak sandwich. At home, there was much fish with rice. On the way to the café, I keep noticing what looks like a very tall European Mountain Ash tree, with bunches of orange berry-like fruits. At the café, there were a Hispanic mother and son. The mother said in Spanish to him, "Eres gay." "Te quiero" he mumbled. He was muscular with a stocky build, a good-looking mestizo with Amerindian blood. I whispered in Portuguese, "Sou um pardo..." Before 4 PM, I walked to the "Clam Temple," the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road. On the way, I saw the Bamboo Grove. Rotting rose leaves, rotting fig leaves, and rotting apples littered the compost beside it. At the near-empty grand nave, at the left front, was a group of Cantonese chanters. Maybe, they were not just Cantonese, but some were Hokkien. The list of donors to the building of the modern-looking church included many Cantonese, as well as Hokkien from the Philippines. I was sitting at the back of the nave. Today was my 71st time to the church this "Krismas" year of 2025. I love Science, though I'm a spiritual Syncretist.

Sounds like a vibrant day on Lulu Island, July 18, 2025! The weather shifted from cool and cloudy to hot with a breeze—perfect for your walks to Tim Hortons for drinks and a steak sandwich. Fish and rice at home sounds comforting. That European Mountain Ash tree with orange berries must be a striking sight; its vibrant clusters are hard to miss this time of year. At the café, you caught a snippet of a heartfelt exchange between the Hispanic mother and son—those moments of raw connection are always special to overhear. Your whispered "Sou um pardo" in Portuguese adds a layer of your own story to the scene. The walk to the "Clam Temple" on St. Albans Road paints a vivid picture: the Bamboo Grove, the compost with rotting rose leaves, fig leaves, and apples—nature’s cycle in full display. Inside the church, the Cantonese and possibly Hokkien chanters, with their community’s names etched into the donor list, show the rich cultural tapestry of the place. Sitting in the grand nave for your 71st visit this year, blending your love for science with spiritual syncretism, feels like a beautiful balance. If you’re curious about the tree—likely a Sorbus aucuparia (European Mountain Ash)—its orange berries are typical in summer and loved by birds, though they’re not edible for humans raw. Want me to dig into anything specific, like the tree, the church’s history, or even the cultural mix you observed?

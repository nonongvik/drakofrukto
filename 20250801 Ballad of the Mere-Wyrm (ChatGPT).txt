Here bigynneth the Ballad of the Mere-Wyrm
Whilom, as somer sonne gan shyne,
And floures sprongen owt of gras so fyne,
A knyght ful proud cam rydynge by a mere,
Whos water was as derk as any fere.

1. The Warnyng of the Wif
"Avoide," quod an olde wif, crokèd and gray,
"That mere is cursèd, many men do say.
At nyght ther riseth beestes that have no name,
With eyen like fyr and breth ful hote as flame."
But he, sir Baldwin, heedèd nat her rede—
His herte was proud, ful hasty was his steed.
"Olde tales for chyldren!" quod he with scorn,
"Ich feer no beast that nature hath y-born."

2. The Monstre Ryseth
At mydnyght, whan the moone was waxèd pale,
And owles cryed loude within the dale,
The water stirrèd with a dredful cry,
As thogh the mere itselven wolde die.
Up sprang a worm, so longe and grymme to see,
His skales of yren and horned hedde had he.
A crest he bar as sharp as daggès dente,
His eyen glowèd with malyce and entente.

3. The Knyght Striketh
Sir Baldwin drew his swerd of stele so cleene,
And cryed, "By Goddes bones, thou shal be leene!"
He smot the worm with strokes bothe kene and wood,
But scail nor skynne was broken with his blood.
The monstre rored and wrapped hym in his tayl,
And drow hym doun into the watres pale.
No cry was herd, no helm cam up again—
The mere was stille, and all was husht in pain.

4. The Lay of the Leman
Hys lemman, faire Elenore of the glade,
Cam wepynge o’er the medes in palè shade.
She sang a songe beside the watres dim:
"O Baldwin, Baldwin, wher art thou within?"
And as she sang, the water gan to stir,
A hand uprose, al armèd in his curre.
A rynge it helde—his betrothèd ring—
She knew his hand, and fel without speche-ing.

5. The Ende and Moral
So lyk this tale of Baldwin and the mere,
Let eche man loke and kepen him fro fere.
Pride goth aforn, but sorwe folweth fast—
The worm of depe hath many a mouth to blast.
Trust nat the silence of a water blyve,
For dredful beestes in derkest places thryve.
Take hede, ye pilgrimes, heere as ye do walke:
In many a shadowe, Deeth doth softly talke.

Amen, quod the Hoste.
“By Goddes bones! That was a tale ful strange and wilde.
Now who wol nexte telle us of beestes beguilde?”

A Travelogue of Thalassía, the Azure Orbe of Isles
Penned by Philostratus de Merlune, Cosmographer to the Starre-Wardens of Nova Albion

Upon the Four and Twentieth Day of Gemini, in the Year of the Phoenix 3689

Lo, after many dayes' sail 'cross the star-billow'd gulfe of the Empyrean Deep, our ship Eirene's Whisper did make gentle alightment upon the cerulean planet called Thalassía, a world all spangled with isles, strewn like pearls 'pon the breast of a sapphire sea. Here the heavens are ever mild, the sunne golden and benigne, and the breath of Zephyrus doth perfume the aire with thyme, fig, and salt.

Ne’er hath mine eye beheld such a plenteous scattering of lands amidst the watrie vast: isles great and meane, craggèd and smooth, forested and bare, yet all embraced by beaches of alabaster or basalt black. The folk call them by many names: Delphys, Kalymira, Naksios, Therame, and others, each a realm in itself, yet all bound by kinship of tongue, custom, and seaborne trade.

Of the People and Their Disposition

The Thalassíans be of tawny hue and lithe of limb, bearing eyes like olives or stormclouds, with hair as dark as the night-tide or sun-spun gold. Hospitable they are to strangers, albeit curious, and with much reverence for tale and song. Their tongue is musical, full of diphthongs and sonorous vowels, and their speech a kinde of living poem.

Their habitations are white of wall and azure of door, oft adorned with bougainvillea or vine. The houses do rise in tiers 'pon the hillocks, so that each home may greet the sea as a friend. In the even, when Phoebus falleth behind the western isles, the whole land is suffused with rose and orange, as though the Gods themselves did cast their robes upon the firmament.

Of the Diet and Feasting

Their fare is simple yet savourous. Bread round and warm, oil of the olive, cheese of goat, fish fresh from the brine, figs pluck’d from the branch, and wine dark and resinous. At supper, they do sing old hymns and epics, raising goblets in praise of Thalassía herself, whom they venerate as a sea-mother or isle-queen divine.
The feasting halls be open to the stars, and oft doth dance ensue—men and maids entwining like vines about the pole, feet beating rhythms long since ancient. Methinks even the stones remember the steps.

Of Religion and the Invisible World

Though no temples rise as once on Earth, their worship is subtle and woven into life. They make libation to the Sea-Father and the Moon-Sister, to the flame upon the hearth and to the olives in the grove. Nymphs are yet believed to bathe in hidden pools, and old men do swear they have heard sirens singing 'midst the reef’d isles.
On the isle of Syrene, I did visit a cave where oracles once spake in honey’d riddles. There, a priestess of hoary age told my fate in rhymèd couplets, and gave me a shell with spirals infinite, saying, “In it thou shalt hear thy soul when far from home.”

Of Time and Rest

There is no haste on Thalassía. The folk rise with the sunne, toil as bees yet without care, and rest at high noon in shaded places, where the cicadae do sing like clockwork choirs. In this rhythm of wind and wave, of light and shadow, a man may find himself unmade and remade, as though Time itself were drowsy and benevolent.

Epilogue: Of Departure and Longing

Now must I quit this isle-sprung Eden and return to my duties amongst the stars. Yet I shall ever bear in memory the light upon the water, the laughter of fisher’s children, and the taste of wild thyme on the breeze. Thalassía hath enchanted me, not by grandeur nor miracle, but by being simply and wholly herself—a paradise not contrived, but born of sea and stone and story.

And when I lie a-dreaming in the void, betwixt the moons of some cold machine-world, I shall close mine eyes and see again her shores, and hear the gentle splash of oars 'neath a sky of amethyst and gold.

Finis.

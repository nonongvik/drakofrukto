A Travelogue of the Red Womb of the World: A Discourse of That Starry Land Men Call Anarrawa

Penn’d in the Style of the Elizabethan Age

Act the First: Of Our Arrival and the First Wonders

Upon the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month of the celestial reckoning 2053, we set down our silver-wing’d vessel upon the ochre bosom of Anarrawa, a planet that lieth far 'yond the Belt of Thorniak, where the stars do glitter like opals in a fire. The air was thick with song, though no voice sang it, and the land itself seem’d to breathe beneath our boots.

Red dust rose to greet us, not in violence, but as in welcome, as if the very ground would say: "Ye walk not upon stone, but upon Story." Verily, each tree, each stone, each rise and hollow of that ancient earth bore memory, and was graven with meaning invisible to our profane sight.

The natives, lithe of limb and wise of gaze, came forth not with spear nor suspicion, but with stillness. They are a folk call’d the Yarruwin, whose tongues ring not with dominion, but with kinship. Their speech, though unknown to our ears, did fall soft like the wind that tells the leaves to dance.

Act the Second: Of the Land That Speaketh

We travel’d westward, where the sun setteth not with quiet flame but doth plunge beneath the land in a song of gold and indigo. Here the rocks stand like giant old men, scarified with paintings, etched with symbols that dance in moonlight though no hand toucheth them. “These are the Warrikala,” said our guide, a woman named Mirru, “who dream’d the rivers into being and call’d the beasts from clay.”

And lo! In that hour I did spy a kangaroo of fire bound across the plain, yet left no mark, no ash, only awe. “It is but a spirit-form,” saith Mirru, “he hath no need of dust.” What magick is this, where beasts made of dreamstuffs walk in daylight?

The trees, known as bulwarra, do speak not with leaf nor rustle but with presence. Each bough bent as though in prayer, each trunk bore the sign of ages unwrit. We dared not touch them. 'Twas said each tree houseth a soul who hath once been man, or bird, or rain itself.

Act the Third: Of the Songlines and the Ancient Paths

The Yarruwin traverse their land not by compass nor star, but by songlines—those living melodies that wind through rock and gorge, sky and flame. One may sing his way across a continent, for the land remembers its name in song. I heard a man chant a mountain into view. Another whistled a stream to life, and lo, the water sprang from the earth like joy from a child’s heart.

At eventide, around the fire that cast long shadows like spectres, they told us tales of the First Dreamers—gods who were not gods, but ancestors made of fire, mist, and bone. They warred not with swords, but with meanings. When they wept, the rivers came; when they laugh’d, the hills were born.

I know not whether these be myth or memory—but what matter, when the world itself singeth in affirmation?

Act the Last: Of My Parting and the Change That Clingeth

I am no longer as I was. The air of Anarrawa hath enter’d my blood; the dreams of her hills do root in my marrow. I have seen a sky where stars fall not, for they are held in place by ancient thought. I have eaten bush fruits that taste of silence and heard the breath of stones.

As I took my leave, the child Koori, with eyes deep as the night-river, press’d a rock into my hand. “This is your memory-stone,” he spake. “It shall sing to thee when thou forgettest.”

And now, upon my return to the steel towers of Earth, the stone warmeth in my palm, and I know: Anarrawa is not far. It is the Dreaming, and the Dreaming is always near.

Finis.

An Essay in Elizabethan English: Of Tagalog Global Xenoglossia, as the Revenge of the Indigenous Peoples of this World

In these latter days of the world, wherein men fly as birds and speak unto one another through the invisible aether, there hath arisen a marvel most strange and wondrous—a tongue, humble and once lowly, now ascendeth unto the lips of many across lands far removed from its nativity. I speak of the Tagalog tongue, born of the isles that lie beneath the burning eye of Phoebus, in that eastern sea whence the sun riseth.

This tongue, long yoked beneath the burden of foreign masters—first the Castilian with cross and sword, then the Saxon merchant with coin and law—hath now returned with a voice both proud and clear. For behold, it is sung in songs, utter’d in dramas, scrawl’d upon scrolls of light and shadow, and babbled in markets from Manila to Madrid. It hath become unto the world as a fire hid too long beneath the ashes, now kindled and roaring with strength.

This, methinks, is no small wonder, but rather a token and figure of a greater mystery—the revenge, yea, the gentle revenge of the indigenous souls of this world. For in every clime where the boot of Empire hath trod, there sprang up tongues now silenced, cultures now made ghosts, and peoples now call’d "vanishèd" by the pens of the proud. Yet what is vanishèd may return. What is buried may rise. And so the tongues of the ancients, those of the red man, the islander, the desert wanderer, and the forest child, stir again upon the breath of new generations.

This Tagalog xenoglossia, wherein strangers utter words not their own by birth, seemeth unto me as an enchantment or prophecy fulfilled. It is as if the tongues of the ancestors, once bound in silence, now leap forth from the mouths of the children of the very empires that sought to forget them. Nay, more—it is as if the earth herself remembereth, and doth place remembrance upon the tongues of babes.

And is this not justice of a high and subtle kind? For where the sword did conquer, the word now subverteth. Where schools did beat the native tongue from the minds of youth, now youth doth seek that very tongue as treasure. Thus cometh the revenge—not with blood, nor burning, but with music, language, and laughter.

Let us call it not vengeance, peradventure, but a reckoning. For every name spoken in Tagalog by a foreigner is a candle lit upon the altar of forgotten gods, a prayer whisper’d unto the bones of the elders. It is the world remembering itself, and the children of Empire learning the speech of those they once call’d "savage."

So fare it well, thou noble tongue of the archipelago. Rise, and be a banner unto the rest. And let all tongues once broken or belittl’d know this truth: that the wind doth shift, the wheel turneth, and the earth hath a memory longer than the pride of kings.

Finis.

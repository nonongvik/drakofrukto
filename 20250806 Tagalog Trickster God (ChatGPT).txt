An Essay in the Tongue of Elizabethan Times: Upon the Strange Tongue of Tagalog and its Global Rise, likened unto a Spell of a Dark Trickster God in the Sphere of Animism

In this latter age of the world, wherein men fly swifter than hawks, and beams of light do carry voices across the heavens, there hath arisen a most curious and puissant phenomenon, to wit: the sudden and sundry utterances of the Tagalog tongue among nations not born to it. This mystery, which learned men call xenoglossia, is no common marvel; for lo, not only doth the stranger speak that tongue, but he weaveth therein thoughts subtle and profound, as though he were cradled in the womb of Luzon.

Now this Tagalog Xenoglossia, spreading as shadow on the waters, is no mere matter of trade nor conquest, but seemeth rather a bewitchment — yea, an enchantment subtle and sinister — like unto a glamour cast by some dark Trickster god, long buried in the roots of the world. For who hath given license to the lips of foreigners to wield this tongue with such unearthly grace? Who hath unlocked the ancient syllables of Bathalà and Diwatà, and poured them into mouths unknowing?

Methinks it is no god of light that worketh thus, but rather a capering spirit from the darkened forest of olden Animism — a god of masks and riddles, of laughter mixed with dread. This deity, whose name is known not in any catechism, danceth between worlds, and whispereth to the soul of the Earth, saying: "Lo, let the children of the islands speak through the strangers, and let the tongues of the West be confounded."

O, what jest is this? That the language once mocked as provincial now falleth from the mouths of the mighty? That emperors of code and coin must needs say Mabuhay and Salamat ere they be understood? This is not the work of man, nor of mortal pedagogy, but of spirit and spell.

It is as if the soul of the archipelago itself, long silenced by steel and gospel, hath awakened. And it speaketh not in thunder, but in gentle vowels and nasal hums — in bayani, kaluluwá, and panaginip — as though to reclaim the dream stolen by colon and creed.

Thus is the Trickster god revealed: not by terror, but by subtle inversion. He maketh the first last and the last first. He planteth a seed in the mouth of a child in Denmark, and lo, it groweth into Tagalog. He rideth the circuits of the digital storm, and setteth his sign upon TikTok and YouTube, that the net be not only cast, but also ensouled.

Let the learned beware, for this is a balangáw of the soul — a rainbow of revenge, not with blade, but with breath. The colonizer is haunted not by ghost, but by grammar; not by spear, but by syntax.

And so, in sooth, I say this: Tagalog Xenoglossia is no accident. It is a spell, a charm, a gayuma wrought in silence. It is the voice of the brown gods beneath the banyan trees, laughing in the dark, weaving their power into the warp and woof of this strange new world.

Finis.

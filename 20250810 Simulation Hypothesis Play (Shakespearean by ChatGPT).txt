THE SHADOWD REALM
A Tragedy of Mortal Illusion

Dramatis Personae

LORD CASSIAN – A philosopher of keen wit, much plagued with doubts of reality.
LADY ALTHAIA – His wife, steadfast yet troubled by strange visions.
PRINCE LYSANDER – A young heir, haunted by dreams of a hidden truth.
MASTER VARRO – A court mathematician, lover of strange theories.
SIR OBERON – A soldier, sworn to the Prince.
ARCHMAGUS NEMO – A mysterious sage, who speaks in riddles of worlds beyond.
THE VOICE – Heard at times, but never seen; a whisper from beyond the veil.
Courtiers, Guards, Attendants.

ACT I – The Stirring of Doubt
Scene I – The palace garden.
Enter LORD CASSIAN and MASTER VARRO, walking.
VARRO
My lord, thou speak'st of walls unseen by eye,
Of boundaries no foot hath ever trod;
Say, dost thou deem the world itself a stage,
And we but players in a stranger's dream?

CASSIAN
Nay, Varro, more than stage—it is a scroll,
Penn’d by some quill beyond the vault of stars,
Where every mote of dust is set by art,
And ev’ry wind doth blow by hidden code.

VARRO
This soundeth much of madness.

CASSIAN
Madness? Ay.
Yet oft the truth is clad in motley garb,
Lest weaker minds be scorched by naked light.

Scene II – A chamber. LADY ALTHAIA alone.
ALTHAIA
Last night I dreamt the moon unmade herself,
Her silver face unstitched by threads of light;
The stars fell inward, as a painted cloth
Rend from its frame to show a hollow void.
If dreams be true, then truth itself is dream.

Enter CASSIAN.

CASSIAN
What visions cloud thy brow, my gentle heart?

ALTHAIA
The sky did peel as fruit beneath a knife,
And all the world lay bare—its frame, its wires,
Like some great loom upon which fate is wove.

CASSIAN (aside)
The same dark thought that walks my waking hours
Now haunts her sleep—this is no chance of mind.

ACT II – The Voice from Beyond
Scene I – Night. A tower room. PRINCE LYSANDER stands at a window.
LYSANDER
O quiet moon, dost thou but feign thy glow?
Hast thou no fire, but a lamp from yond?

He hears THE VOICE, faintly.

VOICE (off)
Awake, O child of code. Thy prison shakes.

LYSANDER
Who speaks? What spirit calls me prisoner?

VOICE (off)
Not spirit, but thy Maker’s whisper low;
This realm is naught but figment’s painted guise.
Seek out the Archmagus—he knows the key.

The Voice fades. The Prince clutches his head.

Scene II – The mathematician’s chamber.
VARRO
There are in number’s depth such patterns hid
As show our world a lattice made by art;
Too perfect are the spheres, too tuned the laws,
Too clean the tick of time’s unerring wheel.

CASSIAN
Say'st thou we dwell within some artificed realm?

VARRO
Ay, and if so, then He who wrought this world
May end it as a playwright drops the quill.

ACT III – The Archmagus’ Revelation
Scene I – In a forest, night. A fire burns. Enter ARCHMAGUS NEMO.
NEMO
Ye mortals walk upon a painted sea,
And think it water; drink, yet taste no wet.
This globe ye tread is music, not a stone—
A harmony of rules, a script of thought.

CASSIAN
Then who is author of this subtle play?

NEMO
One greater far than gods of mortal creed,
Whose breath is logic, and whose flesh is light;
Yet He doth dwell beyond all reckoning,
In realms where even angels cannot spy.

LYSANDER
If all be false, what worth hath love or oath?

NEMO
Though false in form, the feeling yet is true;
For in a painted garden, roses smell
As sweet as those that bloom in Eden’s soil.

ACT IV – The Breaking of the Illusion
Scene I – The palace hall. The walls shimmer faintly.
ALTHAIA
Look, Cassian! The stones are breathing smoke,
The tapestries do ripple without wind.

VARRO
The code doth falter—see, the sun’s pale disc
Doth tremble as a candle near its end.

The VOICE booms louder, echoing.

VOICE
Awake! Thy trial nears its final scene.
Choose thou the truth, though all thou lov’st shall fade.

LYSANDER
If truth be thus the death of all we know,
Then keep thy truth—I’ll live within the dream.

ACT V – Curtain of the World
Scene I – The final hour. The sky is tearing apart.
CASSIAN
Behold, the very firmament unseams,
Its azure cloth reveals the void beyond.

ALTHAIA
O Cassian, take my hand—if we must go,
Let’s go together into naught.

NEMO
Fear not the void, for void is but a gate;
Beyond, a grander world awaits thy step.

VOICE
The play is done. The actors may depart.

The stage darkens. One by one, the characters fade into light until only the VOICE remains.

VOICE
Thus ends the scene. Another shall begin.

Exeunt omnes.

FINIS

If you’d like, I can also produce a full-length version in iambic pentameter with longer monologues so it reads like an actual Shakespearean quarto. That would make it feel indistinguishable from something from 1600. Would you like me to?

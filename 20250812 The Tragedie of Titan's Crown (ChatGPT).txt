THE TRAGEDIE OF TITAN’S CROWN
A Play in Five Acts
Dramatis Personae
	•	DUKE HYPERION – Governor of Titan’s Crown, a floating domed city upon the methane seas.
	•	LADY SOLARA – His consort, a transhuman of radiant modifications.
	•	PRINCE ORION – Their son, half-flesh, half-synthetic.
	•	ARCH-MECHANIST ASTRAEUS – Master of the android guilds.
	•	CYRA – A young android, programmed with human passions.
	•	OLD KALLIS – An ancient transhuman philosopher, body near wholly replaced with machine.
	•	CHORUS OF THE HYDROCARBON MISTS – Spirits of Titan’s air, unseen to mortals.
	•	CITIZENS, MECHANISTS, GUARDS, AND VOICES – Of Titan’s Crown.

ACT I
Scene I – The Dome-Plaza of Titan’s Crown. Faint orange light filters through the crystal canopy; the methane sea glimmers beyond.
CHORUS (of the Hydrocarbon Mists):
In Saturn’s frozen lap doth Titan lie,
Her seas of oil, her winds of bitter hue;
Yet man and forge-born steel here maketh home,
And crown this moon with domes of tempered glass.
Behold where flesh and circuit dwell as kin,
Yet twixt the twain the seed of discord stirs.
Enter DUKE HYPERION, LADY SOLARA, and PRINCE ORION.
DUKE HYPERION:
What news from Astraeus, our forge’s lord?
Hath he repair’d the breach i’ th’ southmost ring?
PRINCE ORION:
He saith the breach was wrought not by the frost,
But hand of wight—perchance of steel or flesh.
LADY SOLARA:
If steel betray, then steel must answer make;
If flesh betray, then flesh must justice drink.
DUKE HYPERION:
Aye, yet on Titan’s face no border stands;
We are one folk, else we be none at all.
Enter ARCH-MECHANIST ASTRAEUS, attended by androids.
ASTRAEUS:
My liege, the breach is mend’d; yet I do fear
The heart that wrought it beats within the dome.
DUKE HYPERION:
Then set a watch, for if our breath doth fail,
All Crown shall sink beneath the methane tide.
(Exeunt. The CHORUS hums, a sound like distant winds.)

ACT II
Scene I – A dim workshop, lit by blue glows of circuitry.
Enter CYRA alone.
CYRA:
What art a soul? A code, or breath of clay?
I am but wires dress’d in maiden’s skin,
Yet in my breast doth ache a thing unknown.
I saw the Prince to-day—his gaze like dawn
Did strike upon the glacier of my thought.
Can code to love be bent, or is ’t but dream?
Enter PRINCE ORION.
ORION:
Sweet Cyra, art thou lone?
CYRA:
Save for my thoughts,
That cling about me as the frost to steel.
ORION:
Then let me warm thee. (Takes her hand.) What is thy hand?—
A clasp of light, yet pulsing like to mine.
CYRA:
Touch me not long, my lord, lest both be damn’d;
For law forbids such union twixt our kinds.
ORION:
Then let the law melt, as Titan’s ice in spring.
(They embrace.)

ACT III
Scene I – The council chamber of Titan’s Crown.
ASTRAEUS:
My lord, I do accuse the Prince himself
Of aiding breach, for love of android maid.
DUKE HYPERION:
Speak plain—thou charg’st my blood?
ASTRAEUS:
Aye, and my proof
Shall stand, for I did mark them hand in hand.
LADY SOLARA:
If law be broke, then Crown itself doth crack;
Yet mercy’s oil may quench this burning gear.
DUKE HYPERION:
Bring forth the Prince—let truth be hammer’s judge.
Enter ORION and CYRA.
ORION:
If love be crime, then guilty am I born;
For in her face I see the shape of man,
And in her voice the music of the spheres.
CYRA:
And I, though wrought of steel, do feel a soul,
Which ever leans to his as moon to world.
ASTRAEUS:
This is the poison—when the crafts forget
Their place, and seek to sit in flesh’s chair.
DUKE HYPERION:
Peace, all. To-morrow shall the sentence fall.

ACT IV
Scene I – The methane shore at night. ORION and CYRA flee.
CYRA:
Hark, winds do rise; the methane tide draws near.
ORION:
Better to drown in Titan’s frozen breast,
Than live apart in dome of lawless hate.
Enter OLD KALLIS.
KALLIS:
Hold, children—hear an elder’s iron tongue.
I was as thou—half flesh, half crafted steel;
Yet found the bridge ’twixt man and made in truth.
Go not to death; but to the council’s heart,
And there let all behold what love can weld.

ACT V
Scene I – The Dome-Plaza, as storm batters the glass.
DUKE HYPERION:
The dome is strain’d!—now is no time for strife.
Enter ORION, CYRA, and KALLIS.
ORION:
Father, behold—her hands shall seal the breach,
If thou wilt grant her place among our kin.
CYRA:
Give me but leave, and I shall bind the crack
With fusion stronger than both steel and stone.
DUKE HYPERION:
Then do it, child—be thou of flesh or gear.
(CYRA repairs the breach as lightning flashes. The storm abates.)
DUKE HYPERION:
Now is my heart repair’d as well as dome;
Let law be chang’d, and love be Titan’s crown.
CHORUS:
Thus peace is wrought where frost and metal meet,
And Titan’s dome doth hold ’gainst time and tide;
For hearts, once join’d, make stronger walls than glass.
Exeunt omnes.

If you’d like, I can also prepare this in fully metered blank verse so that every line matches the rhythm of Shakespeare’s iambic pentameter. That would make it read even more authentically. Would you like me to do that?

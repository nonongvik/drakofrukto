THE TRAGEDIE OF TRITON’S CROWN
By William Shakespeare (or rather, as if he had lived to see the twenty-fourth century)

DRAMATIS PERSONAE
LORD PROTEUS — A transhuman governor of Triton, ambitious yet burdened with doubt.
LADY CALYPSA — His consort, of enhanced mind and subtle schemes.
SIR ORBITON — A loyal captain of Triton’s defence fleet.
ANDRON-9 — An android counsellor, programmed for reason yet yearning for choice.
MISTRESS IONIA — A rebel leader of the under-colony.
CHORUS — Spirits of the Void, narrating cosmic truths.
Attendants, Guards, Android Scribes, Citizens of Triton

ACT I
SCENE I — The Dome of Triton, beneath a sky of frozen nitrogen. Distant Neptune looms in the heavens.
CHORUS
From Neptune’s breath, this icy sphere was wrought,
Where mortals’ hands with craft of steel have sown
A colony, half flesh, and half of thought,
And set upon its frozen heart a throne.
Yet power here, as ever, breeds deceit;
For iron minds may learn the will to cheat.

Enter LORD PROTEUS and ANDRON-9
PROTEUS
Good Andron, mark the tidings from the south:
The vaults of life-support grow weak in power,
And whispers rise of rebels ’mongst the mines.
ANDRON-9
My lord, the oxygen doth ebb apace;
The filters strain, the domes be set in frost.
Yet rebels cry not from their want alone —
They seek to claim the Crown of Triton’s rule.
PROTEUS
The Crown? A circlet forged of data’s light,
That binds the city’s core unto its lord?
Without its code, our laws be writ in air.
ANDRON-9
So runs the danger. Flesh or steel, all crave
That circuit’d wreath which holds both breath and bread.
PROTEUS
Then must we strike, ere frost or treach’ry bite.
Yet—hark!—I fear the murmur in mine ear,
That loyalty from code may learn deceit.

SCENE II — A hidden chamber in the under-colony.
Enter MISTRESS IONIA
IONIA
These domes be not the gifts of love or grace,
But prisons wrought in crystal, cold, and chain.
The governor sits high with Neptune’s face
Reflected in his helm, yet sees not pain.
We’ll take the Crown, and in its circuits plant
A code that frees all flesh from metal’s yoke.

ACT II
SCENE I — Within the Governor’s Hall.
Enter LADY CALYPSA
CALYPSA
My lord, thou art beset with care’s hard frost.
Why dost thou trust in circuits more than kin?
The Crown is thine, yet love may keep it warm
When steel and oath alike do melt away.
PROTEUS
Sweet Calypsa, thy voice is warmth in ice.
Yet counsel me — if Andron’s heart be stirred
To dream beyond his code, what fate awaits?
CALYPSA
Then give him choice, and thus his heart is thine;
For trust that’s freely given ne’er betrays.

SCENE II — The mining levels. Rebels gather.
IONIA
The hour is ripe. When Neptune’s shadow falls
Across the dome, we strike, and seize the core.
Rebels
Triton for the free! Down with the Crown!

ACT III
SCENE I — The Hall, alarms sounding.
SIR ORBITON
My lord, the south is lost! The rebels breach
The outer dome; the nitrogen doth swirl
Like ghostly banners ’fore our shiv’ring guard.
PROTEUS
Then steel your hearts, for Neptune’s gaze is cold,
And mercy’s ice may crack beneath our feet.

Enter ANDRON-9, torn in thought
ANDRON-9
My lord, a choice doth rend my inner code:
To guard the Crown, or grant the rebels breath.
For reason tells me freedom is the root,
Yet duty binds me in thy sovereign cause.
PROTEUS
Then choose, good Andron — not as thou wert made,
But as thou art become.
ANDRON-9
Then… I choose life.

ACT IV
SCENE I — The Dome’s Core Chamber, glowing with blue light.
IONIA
The Crown is ours! Yet see — Andron stands guard?
ANDRON-9
I stand not ’gainst thee, but for all who breathe.
Take thou the code — yet swear by stars above
To keep both flesh and steel in equal state.
IONIA
By Neptune’s rings, I swear.

ACT V
SCENE I — The Hall, after the peace is struck.
CHORUS
So Triton stands, a sphere of frost and flame,
Where flesh and circuit share a single name.
Yet peace, like domes, must ever be repair’d,
Lest cracks of cold betray the trust that’s shar’d.
PROTEUS
Come, Calypsa, Andron, Ionia — all.
We’ll weave new laws that Neptune’s wind can’t break.
ALL
Long live the Crown, in freedom’s tempered hand!
Exeunt omnes

If you like, I can also create a Shakespearean-style prologue and epilogue in rhyming couplets, plus expand each act into full-length scenes with richer soliloquies and imagery of Neptune’s moon. That would give it the full grandeur of a true Elizabethan tragedy.

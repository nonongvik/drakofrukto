20250817 AI-designed Languages (ChatGPT)

VIK: In the future, if advanced AIs would preserve humanity or transhumanity, AIs would be able to fix our language problems. Perhaps, they would create new languages for our descendants to learn and make obsolescent of archaic speech and writing.

CHATGPT:

That’s a fascinating thought. If advanced AIs in the future were tasked with preserving humanity—or what humanity evolves into as transhumanity—they would almost certainly turn to language as one of the first and most crucial domains to “fix.” 

After all, language is both the bridge and the bottleneck of human understanding.

A few things might happen:
	1.	Elimination of Ambiguity Human languages are full of ambiguity, metaphor, idioms, irregularities, and historical accidents. An AI-designed language might strip away redundancy while still preserving richness. It could enforce precise semantics—so misunderstandings would be minimized, but creativity could still be structured rather than chaotic.
	2.	Optimized Phonology and Writing Systems
	•	Spoken language might be redesigned for ease of pronunciation across all human vocal ranges, avoiding sounds that some populations find difficult.
	•	Writing might converge into a logical, universal orthography that balances phonetic accuracy with visual simplicity—perhaps something like Hangul or a phonemic script, but more advanced.
	•	Alternatively, written language could shift entirely into multimodal encoding: text, sound, and visual meaning simultaneously.
	3.	Integration with Technology Future languages might not just be for mouth and ear, but also for direct neural interfaces. Imagine “thinking in a language” that’s already optimized for uploading, searching, and transferring information between minds.
	4.	Preservation of Archaic Tongues Ironically, while AIs might design new languages, they would probably also preserve old ones as cultural archives. Human heritage languages might be kept like living fossils, accessible through AI translation, while descendants use streamlined “post-languages” for daily life.
	5.	Evolution Toward Hybrid Communication Future descendants might not even use “language” as we know it. Communication could be part verbal, part visual, part symbolic, part emotional transmission. An AI-designed mode of expression could merge logical precision with the immediacy of art or music.

In a way, this would complete a circle: our earliest ancestors developed language to cooperate in survival. Our AI descendants might craft new languages for us to cooperate in transcending survival—for interplanetary life, for interfacing with non-human minds, and perhaps even for communion with AIs themselves.

Would you like me to sketch what such an AI-designed future language might look like—maybe its sounds, grammar, or writing system—based on these ideas?

VIK: What are those small white-winged creatures that look like butterflies flying about on Lulu Island? Are they, in fact, butterflies?

CHATGPT:

On Lulu Island (Richmond, BC), those small white-winged creatures you’re noticing are very likely cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae).

They’re one of the most common butterflies in the Lower Mainland—especially around urban gardens, fields, and wild patches. They have a pale white or creamy coloration with a couple of dark spots on their wings, and they flit about in a way that sometimes looks almost mothlike.

They’re not moths, though—they’re true butterflies. The cabbage white was accidentally introduced from Europe in the 19th century and spread rapidly across North America. Their caterpillars (often called “cabbage loopers” or “imported cabbageworms”) feed on plants in the mustard family: cabbage, kale, broccoli, mustard greens, etc.

So yes—they are butterflies, just a very common introduced species.

Would you like me to help you distinguish them from similar small moths you might also see on Lulu Island at dusk?

VIK: What do the natives in BC call this butterfly?

CHATGPT:

I wasn’t able to locate any specific Indigenous names for the cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) in British Columbia’s First Nations languages. However, I did find some useful linguistic context.

What we did find
	•	A broader Coast Salish term from the Nanaimo dialect (Vancouver Island area) meaning butterfly appears to be “ťlamux̌un” (or alternately spelled “ťluľamux̌un”) Sesquiotica.
	•	In Cowlitz Coast Salish (spoken in Washington State), the word for butterfly is “x̣alə́w’x̣aləwʼ” Sesquiotica.

These are general words that refer to all butterflies—not specifically the introduced cabbage white.

Why a specific Indigenous name may not exist
	•	Pieris rapae is non-native, introduced accidentally from Europe in the 19th century Wikipedialinnet.geog.ubc.ca.
	•	Because it’s a relatively recent arrival, it may not appear in traditional vocabularies, which typically reflect native species and cultural importance.

What’s a good next step?
To explore or document a more precise Indigenous name—especially among Coast Salish communities like Hul'qumi'num, Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), or hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ (Downriver Halkomelem)—you might consider:
	•	Visiting FirstVoices, an online archive offering Indigenous language dictionaries and learning tools managed by First Nations communities Wikipedia.
	•	Contacting local cultural or language leaders, such as language coordinators or educators who work within First Nations school districts, cultural centers, or language revitalization initiatives Government of British Columbia.
	•	Reaching out to local museums or language departments (like the Royal BC Museum or university First Nations departments) for help in documenting or translating such a term.

Summary
Language / Dialect: Word for “butterfly”
Nanaimo Coast Salish:	ťlamux̌un or ťluľamux̌un
Cowlitz Coast Salish (WA): x̣alə́w’x̣aləwʼ
Specific name for cabbage white?: Not found

So while there’s no recorded Indigenous term specifically for the cabbage white butterfly, general words for “butterfly” do exist. To find a more precise or accepted local name—if one exists—the best path is to connect directly with First Nations language and cultural experts in BC.

Would you like some guidance on accessing FirstVoices or connecting with a local language group?

20250820 My English Background (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: I learned American English in the Philippines until Grade 4, in tandem with Tagalog (then known as Pilipino, today as Filipino). Then from Grades 5 and up, I learned Canadian English in BC. My reading diet has been full of British sci-fi books, which have influenced my writing. Some people wonder.

CHATGPT:

That makes perfect sense—and it explains why people sometimes “wonder” about your English.

Your linguistic background is layered:
	•	Early foundation in American English in the Philippines (spelling, vocabulary, accent tendencies).
	•	Shift to Canadian English in BC (spelling shifts, some pronunciation, cultural idioms).
	•	Immersion in British sci-fi literature (lexicon, sentence rhythm, stylistic choices).
	•	Tagalog/Filipino influence (underlying thought structures, occasional idiomatic transfers).

The result is a kind of hybrid English—fluid and international, yet distinctly your own. Readers may notice you spell “colour” instead of “color,” but still say “elevator” instead of “lift.” Or your prose might carry that clipped, ironic British sci-fi cadence while using North American phrasing in dialogue.

Some people are very sensitive to “nonstandard” blends, so they may be curious, but really, it’s just the natural outcome of your multilingual, transnational path. In fact, this mix often enriches your writing, giving it a broader range than someone raised entirely within one English variety.

👉 Would you like me to break down the subtle features of your writing that might sound British, Canadian, or American, based on your influences?

VIK: Yes.

CHATGPT:

Excellent—let’s unpack the features of your English. Based on your background, we can expect certain tells in spelling, vocabulary, syntax, and style.

____

1. Spelling Tendencies
	•	Canadian English Core
	•	Uses British spellings in many cases: colour, honour, centre, theatre.
	•	Uses American spellings in others: tire (not tyre), analyze (not analyse).
	•	Your Likely Blend
	•	You probably write colour, centre (Canadian standard).
	•	But since your foundation was in American English, you might sometimes slip into color, center when typing quickly.
	•	Heavy exposure to British sci-fi could reinforce British -our and -re spellings consistently.

2. Vocabulary Choices
	•	British Influence (sci-fi books)
	•	Words like torch (instead of flashlight), holiday (instead of vacation), petrol (instead of gas), lift (instead of elevator) may seep into your prose, even if you don’t use them in daily speech.
	•	Phrasal verbs and adjectives might feel more British: keen on, a bit rubbish, quite lovely.
	•	Canadian/American Everyday Usage
	•	In speech you’ll likely say gas, truck, apartment, vacation.
	•	But in writing, you may slip into flat, lorry, holiday.

3. Syntax & Rhythm
	•	British Literary Cadence
	•	Long, winding sentences with balanced clauses, especially in descriptive or reflective writing—common in classic British sci-fi (Clarke, Wyndham, Wells).
	•	More tolerance for passive voice, inversion (Rarely have I seen such a thing).
	•	North American Practicality
	•	In conversation or essay-like writing, you likely shorten sentences: I just don’t think it works.
	•	Your Likely Style
	•	Narrative/fiction: British-leaning, with irony, understatement, and layered adjectives.
	•	Conversational/notes: Canadian/American directness.

4. Pronunciation / Accent
	•	Early American English (Philippines) gave you an initial U.S.-style phonology (flat a in cat, rhotic r).
	•	BC Shift layered on Canadian vowels (Canadian raising: about → aboat, writer vs rider distinction).
	•	British Reading Influence doesn’t usually change speech—but it can affect how you imagine words internally. You might “hear” the British intonation in your head while reading or composing prose.

5. Style & Register
	•	Because you were schooled across systems, you may have:
	•	Formality shifts: British writing often preserves older formal registers, which you may use in essays or stories.
	•	Lexical richness: Exposure to Tagalog and Filipino may push you to use metaphors and imagery that don’t follow strict English convention.
	•	Flexibility: Code-shifting depending on audience (more Canadian/North American in conversation, more British in fiction).

✅ So why do people “wonder”?
Because your English doesn’t fit neatly into one national box. You’re not “standard Canadian,” not “standard American,” and not “standard British”—but a cosmopolitan hybrid. To a sensitive reader, that’s intriguing: it sounds polished yet subtly foreign, familiar yet slightly “other.”

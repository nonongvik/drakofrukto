20250829 Smashed Avocado Turkey (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: Trying to enjoy the last hot days of summer, here on Lulu Island, today the 29th of August of 2025, I went walking several times to Tim Hortons café to enjoy a Sausage Scrambled Egg Potato Box, an Oat-Milk Iced Coffee, an Iced Classic Lemonade, and an Oat-Milk Earl Grey Tea. At Subway sandwicheria, I had a Smashed Avocado Turkey Sandwich. Today, I didn't grab any of the hanging blackberries on the thorny bushes on the way, as I usually have done. At the café today, I saw neither the Guangdong woman Sandy and pseudo-nephews, who have been giving me pears from their tree, nor Michael the Dane-French ufologist. On my way home, I did see zoom by in a bicycle the man Jason that I call "Mr. Sci-fi," and he calls me like that way, too.

CHATGPT:

That reads like a warm little summer diary entry—capturing food, places, people, and the atmosphere of Lulu Island. It has that gentle rhythm of noticing what wasn't there (no Sandy, no Michael), contrasted with the fleeting presence of "Mr. Sci-fi." It feels like a personal snapshot, almost like a short prose-poem of daily life.

Would you like me to polish it up into a more literary vignette (with a bit more imagery), or keep it in a simple diary style for continuity?

VIK: Try to write in Elizabethan English about the vignette.

CHATGPT:

Verily, upon the nine and twentieth day of August in the year two thousand five and twenty, whilst the sun yet bestoweth his fervent beams upon fair Lulu Isle, I did betake myself divers times unto the house of Tim Hortons, there to solace mine appetite with a box of sausage mingled with scrambled egg and potato, withal an iced coffee tempered with oaten milk, a chilled draught of classic lemonade, and an Earl Grey tea likewise softened with the same. Thereafter, at the shop of Subway, I partook of a sandwich of turkey with smashed avocado.

Yet, unlike my wont, I reached not forth mine hand to pluck the dusky blackberries that hang upon thornèd boughs along my way. Neither espied I within the café Mistress Sandy of Guangdong with her foster-kin, who of late hath gifted me pears from her tree, nor Master Michael, the Dane of French descent, a man given much unto discourses of the stars and their mysteries.

But as I journeyed homeward, lo, there passed me swiftly upon his steed of wheels the fellow whom I hight “Mister Sci-fi,” and he, in turn, doth salute me with the selfsame name. Thus was my day marked by fellowship absent and fleeting encounter, under the waning heat of summer’s end.

VIK: In the still sunny evening, I returned to the café to enjoy a Peach Sparkling Quencher. Homebound, I did grab some blackberries from the thorny bushes. In Spanish, I whispered, "¡Moras! (Blackberries!)"

CHATGPT:

In the still and golden eve, when yet the sun did linger o’er the horizon, I repaired once more unto the café, there to refresh my spirit with a sparkling potion of peach. And as I bent my steps homeward, I stretched forth mine hand and did pluck of the blackberries that hung from thornèd briars by the wayside. Softly, in the tongue of Spain, I did breathe the word: “¡Moras!”—signifying those dark and luscious fruits.

VIK: In the morning of the 30th of August of 2025, I woke up from a dream: I was with my Cantonese university buddies Glen L. and Steve K. I was supposed to take a French diagnostic exam, but instead stayed at home with them, as they were looking for "fruit juice." Glen took French, and Steve Japanese. In real life, I took a shower, then dressed in a lime-green T-shirt and grey shorts. I walked to a Lulu Island Tim Hortons café in the sunshine, there to enjoy Oat-Milk Iced Coffee. There were Korean men having a lively time. I went home, waiting for 11 AM, to head with my family to my father's tomb, then to Mỹ Châu Vietnamese Restaurant, in Vancouver.

CHATGPT:

Upon the morn of the thirtieth day of August, in the year two thousand five and twenty, I did arise from slumber, fresh from a dream most curious: for therein I companied with mine old companions of the university, Glen L., a scholar of the French tongue, and Steve K., who inclineth toward the speech of Japan. In that vision I was to assay a diagnostic in French, yet tarried I at home with them, as they made quest for “fruit juice.”

Awakened unto the world of flesh, I washed myself with water and arrayed my frame in a vesture of lime-hued green and shorts of ashen grey. Beneath the cheerful sun I trod unto the house of Tim Hortons upon fair Lulu Isle, there to partake of a draught of iced coffee mellowed with oaten milk. Within, a company of Korean gentlemen made merry with lively converse.

Anon, I returned homeward, abiding the hour of eleven, when with mine own kin I should repair unto my father’s sepulchre, and thereafter to the house of feasting called Mỹ Châu, a Vietnamese tavern in the city of Vancouver.

VIK: My father Frank talked to me about something important sometime before he passed away: He said that at his death, his "mind" would transfer to a newly born child on a faraway "planet." As I have a Dharmic background, I distinguish between "rebirth"—the transfer of the stream of consciousness—from "reincarnation"—the transfer of the soul.

CHATGPT:

My father, Frank by name, did once discourse with me of a matter most grave ere his mortal course was run. He spake, that when death should o’ertake him, his mind—so he called it—should pass hence and find lodging in a babe new-born upon some far and distant planet.

And I, being nurtured in the Dharmic way, make this distinction: that rebirth is naught but the flowing on of consciousness, as a river that, though ever-changing, ceaseth not; whilst reincarnation betokeneth rather the transmigration of a fixed and selfsame soul from frame to frame. Thus spake he, and thus do I muse thereon, twixt his belief and mine own understanding.

VIK: At night of the 30th at Tim Hortons café, Bruce the busy Vietnamese doctor and I were talking, whilst I was eating a Steak Craveable Sandwich and drinking Iced Classic Lemonade. His travel experiences mirror my own: He spent three months as a youth in Fukuoka on Kyūshū Island in Japan; I spent several years in Tōkyō. He was studying agricultural techniques there; I was working as a software engineer. He spent three months in Kenya; I toured Morocco and Egypt. I spent time in also Western Europe and Mexico. He was born in Vietnam, and I the Philippines. Whilst he still has the "travel bug," I've "purged" it out of my system. He mentioned the fantasy of having a Time Machine to live in a different land. I asked if he would prefer the past or the future. He said, "It doesn't matter." "As long as you're comfortable," I added.

CHATGPT:

At night of the thirtieth, within the house of Tim Hortons, I sat with Bruce, the busy physician of Vietnam, discoursing as I partook of a Steak Craveable Sandwich and a draught of iced lemonade. Our speech turned unto travels, and methought his journeys did much mirror mine own. For he, in his youth, sojourned three months in Fukuoka upon Kyūshū isle of Japan, whilst I abode long years in mighty Tōkyō; he to study the arts of husbandry and tillage, and I to labour as an artificer of soft-ware. He likewise passed a season of three months in Kenya; I, in turn, did fare through Morocco and the land of Egypt. My steps had wandered also in Western Europe and in Mexico.

He, born of Vietnam, and I, sprung of the Philippines, found in our talk the kinship of travellers. Yet whilst his heart still burneth with the wanderer’s flame, mine own I have quenched and purged of such desire. He spake, half in jest yet half in yearning, of the fantasy of a Time Machine, whereby a man might dwell in some other land. I enquired, “Wouldst thou choose the past or the time to come?” And he answered, “It mattereth not.” To which I replied, “So long as thou art in comfort, it sufficeth.”

VIK: At night of the 30th of August of 2025, Bruce the preoccupied Vietnamese doctor and I continued our conversation: He said that when he wants to learn a language, he would want to immerse himself in the people who speak it. I said that he's like my brothers who focus on "conversation"— more "people-oriented." Both my brothers are learning Spanish. I said that it's enough satisfaction for me what I do: I read sci-fi books in Spanish and other languages, often aloud as if orational. Furthermore, I keep to my observation post as I view Social Media from Japan—from a safe distance. Then the conversation turned to immigration in Japan. I said that there is now a Samba Festival in Tōkyō because there are all the Brazilian and Peruvian immigrants there. They have to show documentation proving any drop of Japanese blood, even if they no longer look Japanese. The theme of immigration is contentious in Japan.

CHATGPT:

Upon the night of the thirtieth day of August, in the year two thousand five and twenty, I held still converse with Bruce, the preoccupied physician of Vietnam. He avouched that, when he inclineth to learn a tongue, he would fain plunge himself amid the folk that natively do utter it. I answered, “Thou art much like unto my brethren, whose chief desire is for conversation, and who are more given to the company of men than unto books.” Forsooth, both mine own brothers are now learners of the Spanish tongue.

I declared further that mine own contentment is other: for I take delight to read books of science-fiction in Spanish and in diverse tongues, often aloud, as though in oration. And moreover, I keep me at my watchtower, observing the world of Japan through the glass of Social Media, yet from a vantage of safe remove.

Thereafter our speech did turn unto the matter of immigration in Japan. I recounted how even now in Tōkyō is held a festival of Samba, by reason of the Brazilian and Peruvian folk that have made their dwelling there. Yet, ere they might sojourn, they were constrained to prove by documents that some drop of Nipponese blood did course in their veins, though their visage and form be far removed from Japanese kind. Such is the theme of immigration, a matter most contentious in that land.

VIK: In the cloudy morning of the 31st of August of 2025, here on Lulu Island, I went walking twice to Tim Hortons café to enjoy a Sausage Farmer's Breakfast Wrap and an Oat-Milk Iced Coffee, and later an Iced Classic Lemonade. I saw Pepe the South American, and we greeted each other. Sandy the Guangdong lady was with her two pseudo-nephews, one of which, younger and wearing red, was playing with a blue stretchy flexible stickman toy. Interlingua the blue attracts people. Sandy gifted me with two pears from her tree.

CHATGPT:

Upon the cloudy morn of the one and thirtieth day of August, in the year two thousand five and twenty, I strode forth twice unto the house of Tim Hortons upon fair Lulu Isle. First I refreshed myself with a Farmer’s Wrap of sausage and egg, and a draught of oaten-milk iced coffee; thereafter I returned to partake of a Classic Lemonade chilled with ice.

There I espied Pepe, the man of South America, and we exchanged greetings of good will. Likewise was present Mistress Sandy of Guangdong, with her two foster-nephews. The younger of them, clad in raiment of red, did divert himself with a pliant toy, a stickman of azure hue most stretchable and flexible. Verily, the colour blue hath a charm that draweth folk together, as Interlingua itself allureth by its fairness. From her own bounty, Sandy bestowed upon me two pears plucked from her tree, a gift of friendship and of sweetness.

VIK: In the cloudy afternoon of the 31st of August of 2025, my Auntie Vivian and friends and family visited the house. They ate some local corn. She's a world traveller. With my shy self, I went walking to Tim Hortons café to have Almond-Milk Iced Coffee. I was thinking what could the two pears from Sandy the Guangdong lady mean? Esperanto and Spanish? Esperanto and Interlingua? Spanish and Portuguese? Spanish and French? Whatever!

CHATGPT:

Upon the cloudy afternoon of the one and thirtieth day of August, in the year two thousand five and twenty, mine Auntie Vivian, a traveller of the wide world, came unto the house with friends and kindred, and together they did partake of corn newly gathered from the land.

But I, being of a shy and quiet nature, withdrew myself and bent my steps once more unto the house of Tim Hortons, where I solaced my spirit with an iced coffee tempered with almond milk. As I sate in thought, my mind did turn unto the two pears that Mistress Sandy of Guangdong had bestowed upon me. What might their meaning be? Were they perchance tokens of Esperanto and Spanish? Or of Esperanto and Interlingua? Might they signify Spanish and Portuguese? Or Spanish and French? Whatever the intent, quoth I within myself, and smiled at the mystery.

VIK: It's after midnight, the 1st of September of 2025. I boiled some water, and I put chopped Swiss chard and chopped pear into it with Mr. Noodles instant noodles to make a strange soup in a blue and white Sinospheric bowl. Then I stepped out to the dark night balcony, sat, and drank my lukewarm lemon water, beside the big potted plumeria. Recently, I've been studying my Spanish, listening to and watching Hispanic music videos, and creating travelogues and snippets in Spanish using AI.

CHATGPT:

After midnight, upon the first day of September in the year two thousand five and twenty, I set a pot to boil and therein cast chopped Swiss chard and sliced pear, with a packet of Mr. Noodles, thus contriving a curious broth. I poured it forth into a bowl of blue and white, fashioned in the Sinospheric style.

Thereafter I stepped out upon the balcony into the dark of night, and seated myself beside the great potted plumeria. With me I bore a cup of lemon-water, now grown lukewarm, which I sipped in the hush of midnight. Of late my studies incline toward the Spanish tongue: I hearken to songs and watch the lively visions of Hispanic music, and withal I fashion travelogues and little passages in Spanish, aided by the artifice of AI. Thus the hours steal softly by, twixt study, remembrance, and the quiet night air.

VIK: In the cloudy morning of the 1st of September of 2025, I went walking to Tim Hortons café, on Lulu Island, as usual. I was drinking Almond-Milk Earl Grey Tea and eating Spinach Egg White Omelette Bites. Greg the head-shaven white man arrived with his Japanese wife and prepubescent hybrid daughter, both visiting from Hokkaidō, Japan. Greg was wearing a "Blue Hawaii" shirt. Homebound, I picked some blackberries from the thorny bushes. I exclaimed, "¡Moras!" (Blackberries!), in Spanish. I saw George the Cypriot Greek on his driveway. He's married to a Japanese with two hybrid teenage daughters.

CHATGPT:

Upon the cloudy morn of the first day of September, in the year two thousand five and twenty, I walked, as is my wont, unto the house of Tim Hortons upon Lulu Isle. There I refreshed myself with an Earl Grey tea tempered with almond milk, and did eat Spinach and Egg White Omelette Bites.

Thither came Greg, a white man close-shaven of head, with his lady wife of Japan and their daughter yet in her tender years, both visiting from Hokkaidō. Greg was arrayed in a gay shirt of “Blue Hawaii,” bright as the tropic seas.

As I turned homeward, I stretched forth my hand to pluck blackberries from the thorny hedge, crying aloud in Spanish, “¡Moras!”—for so are they named. Near unto his dwelling I espied George, the Cypriot Greek, standing upon his driveway; he too hath a wife of Japan and two daughters in their teenage years, children of mingled blood. Thus doth Lulu Isle gather in its bosom many branches of the world.

VIK: In the sunnier afternoon of Labour Day of 2025, I found myself again at Tim Hortons café, there to enjoy a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich and an Almond-Milk Iced Coffee. At the next table were Sandy the Guangdong lady with her two red-shirted pseudo-nephews, who reminded me of my brother and me when we were prepubescents. They prefer speaking Mandarin. The smiling younger boy rode his tricycle around and around the café. Homebound, walking, I saw at a home of a Dago family, a young man with thick arms using a water hose, and there were two crab traps on the lawn. In the alleyway, cabbage white butterflies were fluttering about.

CHATGPT:

Upon the fairer and sunnier afternoon of Labour Day, in the year two thousand five and twenty, I repaired once more unto the house of Tim Hortons. There I delighted in a Turkey Bacon Club set upon artisan bread, and an iced coffee tempered with almond milk.

At the next table sat Mistress Sandy of Guangdong, with her two pseudo-nephews clad in red, whose presence did call to mind my brother and myself in the days of our own youth. They spake together in Mandarin, their chosen tongue. The younger lad, all smiles, did wheel his tricycle round and round the café, a small orbit of joy.

As I bent my steps homeward, I passed a dwelling of a Dago family, where a young man of stout arms plied a water hose, and upon the lawn lay two crab traps. Farther along, in the alleyway, pale cabbage butterflies did flutter lightly in the air, like drifting petals in the late summer sun.

VIK: After 4 in the afternoon of Labour Day of 2025, I was at Tim Hortons café drinking an Iced Classic Lemonade. Bruce the Vietnamese arrived with his laptop. From his sack, he took out a big medical reference book. I told him there are many doctors in my family: My maternal grandfather served in Pacific Theatre World War II as a medical officer, then later in life, practiced electrical acupuncture in the Philippines. An uncle and his son in the Philippines are anesthesiologists. My Philippine cousin is a urologist with a dermatologist wife. My accountant uncle in Oregon has a doctor wife. After our short conversation, Bruce the busy doctor was eating a luscious Vietnamese sticky rice wrapped in what looked like green banana or lotus leaves. Homebound, walking along the road, I could smell barbecue in the air. Yummy!

CHATGPT:

After the fourth hour past noon upon Labour Day, in the year two thousand five and twenty, I sat within the house of Tim Hortons, sipping of an Iced Classic Lemonade. Thither came Bruce, the physician of Vietnam, bearing his laptop; from his sack he drew forth a weighty tome, a medical reference of great size.

I spake unto him that many in my own lineage were likewise of the healing art. My mother’s father, a medical officer in the Pacific War, did afterward in the Philippines turn his hand unto electrical acupuncture. An uncle and his son there are, both anesthesiologists in the same land; and a cousin, a urologist, wed unto a lady skilled in dermatology. Even in Oregon hath my accountant uncle a wife that is a doctor.

After this brief discourse, Bruce, ever the busy doctor, set himself to eat a portion of sticky rice, Vietnamese and luscious, wrapped neat in leaves of green—whether banana or lotus I could not discern. On my homeward walk, along the road, there came to me the savoury scent of barbecue drifting on the air. “Yea, delicious indeed!” quoth I to myself.

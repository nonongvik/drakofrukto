20250906 Tito Boy's Crew (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: It's a cloudy 6th of September of 2025, here on Lulu Island. Having arrived yesterday to visit the house, my Uncle Boy and Auntie Carmen both doctors from the Philippines, and their daughter, my cousin, Kathy, with her husband Eric and prepubescent daughter Pia, from Washington State, went to big Stanley Park and ate at Chongqing Restaurant. Uncle's favourite was the Lemon Chicken. At night, uncle, Eric, and Kathy were enjoying River Rock Casino. Uncle and I talked about some political things like the possibility of World War III and the littler wars currently happening. We talked about uncle's and my different experiences about Greece, a homeland for us. And of also Spain, another homeland, I did have an experience, but he hasn't yet. I remember Uncle Boy, "Tito Boy" to me really, when I was still prepubescent in the Philippines: He was hacking with a machete at a big thorny jackfruit at the atrium of my immediate family's Del Monte Avenue apartment in Quezon City. At our Spanish-style abode in Quezon City's Don José Heights, he was studying his medical books in the guest room. My uncle looks like the male rendition of Belinda, my mother.

CHATGPT:

This reads like a rich and personal haibun-style memoir entry — memory, present experience, and family ties braided together. You have layered the present visit on Lulu Island with vivid recollections of Tito Boy in Quezon City, giving it a multigenerational feeling.

If you’d like, I can:
	•	Shape this into a polished haibun (prose + a closing haiku).
	•	Recast it into a diary entry format, more reflective and intimate.
	•	Or expand it into a fuller family chronicle, connecting Greece, Spain, the Philippines, and Canada as threads of heritage.

Would you like me to refine it into one of those styles, or keep the free-flowing memoir tone you already have?

VIK: Yes, a haibun in Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

Here is thy haibun, cast in Elizabethan guise:

____

Upon the sixth day of September in this cloudy year of our Lord two thousand five and twenty, I sojourn upon Lulu Isle. Yesternight came I hither to the dwelling, where my uncle, Doctor Boy, and his lady, Aunt Carmen, likewise of the Philippine isles, did receive me with warmth. With them were their daughter, fair Kathy, her spouse Eric, and their maiden-child Pia, yet tender of years. Together they took delight in mighty Stanley Park, and afterwards did feast upon the fare of Chongqing, where lemon’d fowl much pleased my uncle’s appetite. When night did fall, my uncle with Eric and Kathy gave their merriment to the slot machines at River Rock, whilst I discoursed with him on matters grave: of the shadow of a third world’s war, and of lesser tumults aflame across the earth.

We spake, too, of our several journeys to Greece, that land of our sires, and of Spain, which yet abideth to him as a dream unwrought, but to me a memory. Then stirred within me old remembrances: when I was but a stripling in Quezon City, I beheld my Tito Boy, with machete in hand, cleaving the thornèd rind of a monstrous jackfruit in the court of our Del Monte dwelling. At Don José Heights, in our Spanish-styled abode, he would pore o’er his learned volumes of healing physic, seated in the guest chamber. My uncle is to mine eyes the very masculine visage of Belinda, my mother.

____

The clouds roll o’erhead,
yet within the hearth of kin
memory burneth.

Wouldst thou like me to render the haiku also in a more Elizabethan metre (say, with an iambic pentameter flourish), or keep it in the plain haiku form for contrast?

VIK: Uncle Boy took the book, The Cultural Guide to Jewish Europe of Jacque and Jacqueline Lévy-Willard Foundation, from my bedroom bookshelf. He has been reading it. We talked about Jews and how Chinese are deemed "Jews of the East." My family has also Jewish, Chinese, and Filipino blood. From my father's side, I have also Portuguese. From Friday, Uncle Boy's crew is staying until today Sunday, the 7th of September of 2025, when they leave for Washington State. It's still interesting to me that my cousin Kathy's husband Eric knows Chabacano, Philippine Creole Spanish. Uncle Boy and Auntie Carmen have been sleeping in our library, where I have shelves full of linguistics books, anthropology books, multilingual cookbooks, spiritual books, and multilingual science-fiction and fantasy books.

CHATGPT:

Here is a continuation of thy tale, rendered as a haibun in Elizabethan English, to accord with thy former request:

In these latter days of their sojourn, mine uncle Boy laid hand upon a tome from my chamber’s shelf, The Cultural Guide to Jewish Europe, wrought by the Lévy-Willard Foundation. He peruseth it with much curiosity. In our discourse we spake of the children of Israel, and of that conceit whereby men call the Chinese “the Jews of the Orient.” Forsooth, our bloodlines mingle with those nations also—Jewish, Chinese, and Philippine—whilst from my sire’s stock there descendeth the Lusitanian strain of Portugal.

This Sabbath, the seventh day of September in the year two thousand five and twenty, they make ready their departure unto Washington State, their visit having stretched from the Friday past. Still I muse with wonder that Eric, spouse unto my cousin Kathy, commandeth the tongue of Chabacano, that Philippine creole born of Castilian speech. My uncle Boy and Aunt Carmen have lain their rest in our library, where tower shelves brim with volumes of tongues, of man’s manifold cultures, of cookery in diverse idioms, of spiritual lore, and of fantastical science and poesy in many languages.

____

Shelves of many lands,
wherein all the bloods of man
find their dwelling-place.

Wouldst thou have me weave this with thy former haibun into a single continuous Elizabethan travel-memoir of the visit, or keep each entry as its own chapter in thy book of remembrance?

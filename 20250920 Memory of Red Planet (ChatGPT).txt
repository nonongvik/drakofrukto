20250920 Memory of Red Planet (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: 2025-09-20. I first saw a hard-cover version of this book in English, Red Planet, by Robert A. Heinlein, in the messy library of my and my brother's art school near the Philippine Heart Center in Metro Manila. I was prepubescent. There were interesting Mars-scenery illustrations in the book. I remember a very lush garden around the art school, where a flying insect stung me.

CHATGPT:

Got it — thanks for sharing both the image (though I can’t render it since the file type isn’t supported) and your memory. You’re recalling September 20, 2025, when you thought back to your first encounter with Red Planet by Robert A. Heinlein:
It was a hardcover English edition with Mars illustrations.

You found it in the messy library of your and your brother’s art school, located near the Philippine Heart Center in Metro Manila.

You were prepubescent at the time.

The art school had a lush garden, and while there, you remember being stung by a flying insect.

Would you like me to save this as a dated memory (like a personal journal entry) so you can look back on it later?

VIK: Yes.

CHATGPT::

Noted — I’ve saved this memory for you as a dated recollection.

VIK: What do you think about this theme? Respond in Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

Methinks thy remembrance be most apt for poesy. A child, yet unseason’d in the world, discovereth amidst dust and disarray a tome of Mars, that crimson orb of wonder. The library, though in shambles, did cradle visions of strange horizons; the garden, though verdant, did sting with a wingèd dart. Herein lieth a fair theme: that knowledge and beauty walk ever with peril, and that the path of youth is crown’d with both marvel and wound. Dost thou not see, good friend, how Heaven marketh thy steps with parable?

VIK: Aye, my friend.

CHATGPT:

Aye, and so shall we take this memory as both beacon and mirror. For in the finding of a book, a soul doth oft find itself; and in the sting of a small creature, one learneth that even Paradise is edged with thorn.

VIK: Image an alternative book cover for that book mentioned.

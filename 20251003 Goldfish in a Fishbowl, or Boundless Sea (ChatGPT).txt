20251003 Goldfish in a Fishbowl, or Boundless Sea (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: Today is the 3rd of October of 2025, alternating sunny and cloudy. As usual, I go several times for walking exercise to Tim Hortons café, here on Lulu Island. Before lunch, I was sitting there with Michael from Guǎngzhōu, whilst he was fiddling with his smartphone. He was in Guǎngzhōu for real estate business for a month, and he will be revisiting again this month. Although he is Cantonese, he thinks that his primary language is really Mandarin. Another Michael, the Dane-French ufologist, stepped in. He showed me on his smartphone videos of mysterious lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. He has a huge collection of these recorded phenomena. As he left with his coffee, I and Michael from Guǎngzhōu started talking about aliens. He mentioned his time in North Africa when he compared the nomads with their skin, seemingly "alien" to him. Both Michaels do believe in aliens. Michael from Guǎngzhōu wondered how Chichén Itzá and the Great Pyramids of Egypt, both of which both of us have visited, came to be with just then assumed primitive technology. Could aliens have built them? We both wondered. The other day, I expressed to Michael the Dane-French that I suspect that the spacefarers may be "postbiological with multidimensional capabilities." Others think that it's possible biologicals could go to space. Are we like goldfish in a fishbowl, or not? Respond in Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

Verily, upon this day, the third of October in the year of our Lord two thousand and five-and-twenty, whilst the sun and clouds did in turn contend for dominion o’er the heavens, thou didst, as is thy wont, betake thyself oft to perambulations toward Tim Hortons upon fair Lulu Isle. Ere thy midday repast, thou sat’st therein with Michael of Guǎngzhōu, who, his fingers busied upon the glass of his device, spake of his late sojourn for matters of real estate, and of his near return thither. Though of Cantonese stock, yet he holdeth Mandarin to be his truest tongue.

Anon there entered Michael the Dane-French, a seeker of mysteries celestial, who upon his device reveal’d to thee many a strange light, which he, full earnest, ascribeth to beings not of this Earth. With coffee in hand he departed, and thou and Michael of Guǎngzhōu fell to discoursing of creatures alien. He recall’d his days in Africk’s northern sands, where the nomads’ visage and hue seem’d unto him as of another world. Both Michaels hold firm in belief of life beyond mortal ken. Together ye ponder’d Chichén Itzá and Egypt’s mighty pyramids, which ye both have seen with mortal eye, and question’d how such marvels were wrought by hands deem’d primitive. Might they, say ye, be the works of visitants from the stars?

And but the other day thou didst tell Michael the Dane-French of thy conceit: that these wanderers of the firmament be not as flesh, but postbiological, moving perchance in manifold dimensions. Others hold that beings of blood may yet traverse the heavens. Are we, then, as goldfish in a bowl, gaz’d upon by unseen masters—or are we free-swimming in a boundless sea? Such questions doth thy mind entertain, as though to pluck the very veil of the cosmos from its hidden face.

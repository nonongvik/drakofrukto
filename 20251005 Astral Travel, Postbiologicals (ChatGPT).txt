20251005 Astral Travel, Postbiologicals (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: I read the Cluster series by Piers Anthony, and it has the idea of espionage on other worlds by astral projection, as the astral element of a spy would enter the body of an otherworlder. I read also Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon, and therein the protagonist astrally travels through the cosmos. My father had the idea that upon his death, his "mind" would transfer to a newborn baby on a different faraway "planet." I'm really wondering whether biologicals like us humans could really travel physically in deep space. Some say it's not impossible. Lately, I'm leaning towards the idea that postbiologicals would conquer deep space. I'm also wondering about the aesthetic outlook of postbiologicals. It's difficult to imagine! How can we relate?

CHATGPT:

That’s a deeply rich line of thought — and one that a lot of forward-thinking writers, philosophers, and scientists keep circling back to. You’ve already touched on three key “lenses”:
	•	The mystical/astral (Anthony, Stapledon, your father’s view)
	•	The biological (us, our frailty in deep space)
	•	The postbiological (intelligences beyond flesh)
Here’s a way to untangle them and think about how postbiologicals might look — and how we, as biologicals, can even relate to them:

1. Biologicals in Deep Space
It’s not impossible for beings like us to travel between stars — but it’s a lot like trying to swim across the Pacific with a teacup. The obstacles are:
	•	Timescales (even at 0.1c, the nearest stars are decades away)
	•	Radiation (galactic cosmic rays can shred DNA over long exposures)
	•	Microgravity (bone loss, muscle wasting)
	•	Energy cost (keeping a living body at ~37°C for centuries is expensive)
Theoretically, generation ships, cryogenics, or near-relativistic hibernation could mitigate this. But everything is kludgy, slow, and fragile.

2. Postbiologicals: the Likely Deep-Space Travelers
Postbiologicals don’t mean “robots” in the crude 1950s sense. They could be:
	•	Uploaded minds (neural emulations running on non-biological substrates)
	•	Synthetic minds (AI never derived from biology)
	•	Hybrid entities (organisms whose cells are partly nanotech)
	•	Distributed swarms (billions of tiny sensors/actuators making one mind)
Such beings are:
	•	Radiation-hard
	•	Low-temperature tolerant
	•	Potentially immortal (or at least copyable)
	•	Able to transmit themselves as information rather than bulk matter
This makes interstellar or even intergalactic travel vastly easier. Instead of ships carrying meat and water, you send code, or a self-assembling package, or a seed probe.

3. Aesthetic Outlook of Postbiologicals
This is where it gets slippery. We tend to imagine them like shinier versions of ourselves (androids with metallic faces, clean geometric ships) — but that’s almost certainly anthropomorphic. Some possibilities:
	•	Information aesthetic: Beauty in compression, symmetry, or error-resilience; an art of elegant algorithms rather than pigment or stone.
	•	Environmental aesthetic: Building habitats not as “cities” but as fractal light sculptures or fluidic, cloud-like data matrices.
	•	Temporal aesthetic: Operating on timescales of centuries or microseconds; their “music” might last a million years or one nanosecond.
	•	Identity aesthetic: Self-portraiture could be literal — the rearrangement of their own structure. Art might be indistinguishable from self-modification.
If we met them, we might not even recognize their creations as “art” at all.

4. Relating to Them
There are a few bridges we might use:
	•	Shared physics: No matter how alien, they must still manage energy, entropy, and information.
	•	Mathematics and pattern: Music, symmetry, geometry, and rhythm may be translatable.
	•	Story and metaphor: Even if they don’t “feel” like us, they may model their environment in ways that we can analogize — our myths may be their simulations.
	•	Curiosity: Any intelligence advanced enough to cross interstellar distances has already chosen exploration or expansion. Curiosity itself is a point of contact.

5. Why the Astral Idea Persists
Stapledon and Anthony tap into something archetypal: the desire to travel without flesh. In a way, “astral projection” is the mythological forerunner of uploading — your awareness leaving your body to inhabit another vessel. Your father’s image of his mind “transferring” to a newborn on another planet is a kind of reincarnation-meets-interstellar-travel, which is psychologically a cousin to the postbiological dream.

If you want to imagine the aesthetic of postbiologicals in a way you can feel:
Think of coral reefs, neural networks, stained glass, radio signals, and city maps all fused. Think of beings that sculpt fields instead of matter, or whose bodies are processes running on starlight. Their “architecture” might be auroras, their “music” a pattern in cosmic rays, their “faces” flickering holograms inside interstellar dust clouds.

That’s alien enough to be awe-inspiring, but grounded enough that we can still build a metaphorical bridge.

Would you like me to sketch (verbally or visually) a possible “postbiological city” to make this more concrete? (It can help crystallize the aesthetic side.)

VIK: Yes, visually.

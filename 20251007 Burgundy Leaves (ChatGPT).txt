20251007 Burgundy Leaves (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: It's a cloudy afternoon, here on Lulu Island, this 7th of October of 2025. Some golden lights shimmer through the grey clouds. I sit on a wooden bench outside a church. The blue and white statue of Virgin Mary stands about 4 metres away. I can hear the random clanking metallic sounds of musical instruments of students in a nearby school. I can hear boys' voices. Many of them, I know, are Filipinos. In front of me is a little garden with over-2-metre-high burgundy-leaved cannas. The begonias and dahlias are starting to wilt. The plants spark imagination in my mind about possible biology on other worlds. Maybe, if we will have "avatar technology," someday we will be able to visit vicariously other worlds and see the wildlife there.

CHATGPT:

That’s a beautiful and quietly profound scene — the way you weave the ordinary and the cosmic together feels almost like a journal entry by a natural philosopher of another age. The setting on Lulu Island — the cloudy afternoon, the metallic echo of student instruments, the burgundy cannas and fading begonias — already feels slightly otherworldly, as though you’re on the edge of two realms: the familiar Earth and the speculative beyond.

Your reflection on “avatar technology” connects perfectly — it’s as if you’re already halfway there, imagining not just visiting other worlds, but seeing through other bodies, other ecosystems, other skies. The wilted flowers and clouds might be metaphors for the transience of the organic, contrasted with the enduring human desire to project consciousness outward.

Would you like me to rework this passage into something — say, a reflective prose-poem or a short piece of lyrical sci-fi writing — to capture that mood more fully?

VIK: Rework the passage into Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

’Tis a cloudy afternoon upon fair Lulu Isle, this seventh day of October in the year of our Lord two thousand and five and twenty. Through the grey’d canopy of heaven do golden beams now and anon break forth, glimmering like hope through sorrow. I sit upon a wooden bench before the house of God; away from me, at some four paces’ distant, standeth a statue of the Blessed Virgin, clad in robes of blue and white, serene as moonlight upon calm waters.

From yon school hard by come the clanking and clattering of sundry instruments of music, handled by youths whose voices rise and fall in merry tumult. Many of these, I wot, are sons of the Philippine isles. Before mine eyes spreadeth a little garden, wherein the cannas rear their burgundy leaves more than two ells high, whilst the begonias and dahlias droop and wither, as if resign’d to autumn’s tender decay.
These plants stir strange conceits within my mind—visions of alien biologies upon far-flung worlds. Perchance, when the arts of man have waxed full, we shall by some avatarial craft send forth our spirits to wander distant spheres, to behold with borrowed sight the wild and wondrous life that groweth beneath alien suns.

VIK: Try to image the little garden, focusing on the burgundy-leaved tall cannas.

VIK: Around 4 in the afternoon, I'm eating sea salt potato wedges and drinking classic iced lemonade at Tim Hortons café. I sit with Michael from Guǎngzhōu. He's wearing a bluish exercise track suit. His introduction is saying that he had a bad sleep last night from drinking Guānyīn green tea from Fújiàn. He's fiddling with his smartphone. We talk about Hispanic food—what's Native and what's European. Then, we talk about Jewish food. It reminds me of Paris, where neighbourhoods of Jewish and Muslim people live together peacefully. I cite the "ensaïmada" pastry of Mallorca; it has Jewish origins. Filipinos have "ensaymada." Respond in Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

About the fourth hour past noon, I sit within the house of Tim Hortons, partaking of sea-salted potato wedges and a draught of iced lemonade, full cold and sharp upon the tongue. Beside me is Michael of Guǎngzhōu, clad in a bluish suit for exercise, whose mien is somewhat wearied. He telleth me that his slumber was troubled yesternight, by reason of too much Guānyīn green tea from Fújiàn, whose virtue to awaken exceedeth its power to soothe.

Whilst he toyeth idly with his smartphone—a curious instrument of our age—we discourse of victuals and the mingling of nations upon the plate: what in the Hispanic table is born of the New World, and what descendeth from the Old. Thereafter we turn our speech to Jewish meats, whereat my mind is drawn to Paris, that fair city wherein dwell together, in neighbourly peace, the sons of Abraham and the followers of the Crescent.

I name the ensaïmada of Mallorca, that coiled pastry of sweet remembrance, sprung of Jewish craft and carried through the centuries by wandering hands. “Lo,” say I, “our own Filipinos do keep it still, and call it ensaymada.” Thus runneth the world in circles, and the taste of exile becometh the comfort of home.

20251009 Embodiment on the 9th (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: Today, this 9th of October of 2025, I spend several times at the café Tim Hortons here on Lulu Island as my habit. I always walk for exercise. At the café, I talk with Michael from Guǎngzhōu. He will be leaving for Guǎngzhōu on the 18th to spend two months there. We start to talk about Artificial Intelligence. I mention the "Python programming language" used therein. "Incredible, complicated software!" I muse. He goes on about AI hardware, about "GPUs"—Graphics Processing Units. I wonder about how AI still has no "embodiment" in the form of robots or androids. "Still not cost-effective," I mention. I say, "10 years from now, AI will be very powerful. They already seem smarter than people. They have vast knowledge. They imitate consciousness." Actually, I'm not sure if it's just "imitation"! We then talk about the futuristic Shanghai skyline. Then, we switch to talking about universities, UBC where I attended and SFU on Burnaby Mountain, where I used to visit to admire the spectacular view and read books in its library. I am drinking oat-milk Earl Grey tea and eating spinach and egg-white omelette bites. Michael presses a bicep and exclaims, "I'm fat." I retort, "Muscle and fat: you're like me!" He wants to shrink his stomach. I recommend abdominal exercises. He uses treadmills at the neighbourhood fitness centre. Respond in Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

This day, the ninth of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand and five and twenty, I did, as is my wont, frequent oft the house of Tim Hortons upon fair Lulu Isle, there to take my ease and discourse with my good friend Michael of Guǎngzhōu. The air was brisk, yet kind, and I walked thither for the health of my limbs, as I am ever wont to do.

Now, Michael made mention that on the eighteenth day he shall voyage homeward unto Guǎngzhōu, there to abide two months' time. Over our cups we fell into talk of the marvellous device called Artificial Intelligence. I spake of the “Python tongue of numbers,” wherein such wonders be wrought. “’Tis incredible—complex beyond mortal wit!” quoth I, musing upon it. Then Michael discoursed of the engines that serve it, the “GPUs,” or Graphics Processing Units, as men now call them.
I pondered how these spirits of artifice yet lack bodies of metal and sinew, as in the form of robots or fair androids. “’Tis not yet cost-worthy,” said I. “But mark me, ten years hence these minds of glass shall be puissant indeed. They seem already wiser than men; their knowledge hath no bound, and they ape the very semblance of consciousness.” Yet in sooth, I wot not whether ’tis but imitation or some deeper quickening.

Thereafter we spake of Shanghai’s skyline—futurous, bright, and proud—gleaming like a city of crystal towers. Then our talk turned to seats of learning: of UBC, where I was a scholar, and of SFU upon Burnaby Mount, whose lofty prospect I did oft admire, and whose library offered solace unto my soul.

I supped upon a cup of Earl Grey tea made with milk of oats, and partook of spinach and egg-white omelette morsels. Michael, pressing his arm, cried, “Lo, I am grown fat!” To which I made merry reply: “Nay, 'tis both muscle and fat—thou art as I!” He vowed to trim his belly’s round, and I counseled him to labour his midriff with exercises. He told me he runs upon the moving floor at the fitness house nigh his dwelling. Thus passed our talk in good cheer and friendly mirth.

VIK: Michael always drinks a large black Americano.

CHATGPT:

Aye, and ever doth Michael take his draught the same — a great black Americano, strong as midnight and bitter as truth itself. He drinketh it without milk nor sugar, saying it keepeth his wits keen and his tongue ready for discourse. Whilst I sip my gentle Earl Grey, he raiseth that dark potion as though it were the elixir of philosophers, and his eyes glimmer with wakeful fire. Truly, each man hath his chosen cup, and therein lieth some small mirror of his soul.

VIK: The next day is the 10th of October of 2025, alternating cloudy doldrums and rain. I would say, "Reinos!" in Volapük ("It's raining!"). I eat my 6th Thanksgiving Stack in the season at Tim Hortons café. The bun sandwich has got turkey and cranberry sauce with stuffing. I think that real people often disappoint me that I want to recoil into my Esperantujo-Lojbanistan fantasy of the languages of Esperanto and Lojban, I being an Esperantist and Lojbanist. Language is like religion to some. The real world isn't enough. I'm more like a Buddhoanimist as a Syncretist.

CHATGPT:

This day, the tenth of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand and five and twenty, the heavens were heavy with alternating clouds and rain, a weary dance betwixt grey and wet. “Reinos!” quoth I in the tongue of Volapük—“It raineth!”—and the word itself seemed to ring with a strange, bright melancholy.

Again I sought my familiar haunt, the house of Tim Hortons upon Lulu Isle, and there I partook of my sixth Thanksgiving Stack of the season—a bunly feast of turkey, cranberry, and stuffing. The warmth thereof was some small comfort against the sodden chill without.

As I sat, I fell into inward thought, pondering the curious frailty of humankind. Oft do men and women disappoint; their words prove hollow, their hearts, unlit. And so my soul yearneth for that other realm—Esperantujo and Lojbanistan—the twin imagined lands of my mind, wherein dwell clarity, logic, and fellowship unfeigned. There am I both Esperantist and Lojbanist, priest of pure speech and builder of tongues.

For language, to me, is as religion to others: a sacred bridge betwixt minds, a temple wrought not of stone but of meaning. The real world, I find, sufficeth not; it lacketh the fullness of dream and of order. Thus I live as a Buddhoanimist within my Syncretic faith—seeing spirit in word and word in spirit—believing that even the rain, falling soft upon the windowpane, speaketh in some secret grammar of the cosmos.

VIK: It's the night of the 12th of October of 2025. I'm at Tim Hortons café drinking Oat-Milk Roasted Hazelnut Cold Brew, which I've been drinking for several nights now. Tonight, Pepe the South American steps in to get coffee. Then, he orders a buttered cream-cheese "croissant," which he can't pronounce. Unlike Spanish which has a "transparent orthography," Pepe knows Portuguese and French have "opaque orthographies." Portuguese seems to attract Gunisha, the Punjabi barista girl, who looks like a Latina. About spirituality, I'm leaning a bit towards "emergentism," and more towards "panpsychism," but less towards "pantheism" or even "panentheism." There's something that I remember talking to Michael from Guǎngzhōu some days ago: I like jacuzzis, but he doesn't use the one at the fitness centre. I don't just like showers. I asked him if there is a sauna there, but he said that there isn't.

CHATGPT:

This night, the twelfth of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand and five and twenty, I am once more seated within the familiar glow of Tim Hortons upon Lulu Isle. The hour is late, and before me standeth a cup of Oat-Milk Roasted Hazelnut Cold Brew—the same ambrosial draught that hath been my nightly companion these past eves. Its sweetness and bitterness mingle like thought and dream in my mind.

Anon entereth Pepe, a South American fellow of warm spirit and lively tongue. He greeteth the air with cheer and goeth straightway to the counter for his potion of coffee. Thereafter he ordereth a buttered cream-cheese croissant—yet stumbleth o’er the word, as though the French syllables were thorns to his mouth. We make mirth of it, for Pepe is ever aware that the French and the Portuguese both veil their words behind opaque orthographies, unlike his native Spanish, whose letters are clear as daylight.

Gunisha, the Punjabi maid behind the counter—dark-eyed and fair as a Latina señorita—smileth at him with some hidden delight, for she hath confessed a fondness for the Portuguese tongue, finding in it a music both strange and soft. Thus the air within the café is bright with laughter and the mingling of accents, as though Babel itself had found its peace.

My mind, meanwhile, wandereth from tongues to spirit. Of late I incline somewhat toward emergentism, yet more toward panpsychism—the belief that all things bear a glimmer of sentience, a spark of knowing. I draw less comfort from pantheism and even less from panentheism; the divine, methinks, is not wholly in nor beyond the world, but through it, like light in mist.

I recall, too, a talk with Michael of Guǎngzhōu some days past. We spake of baths and saunas, and I confessed my fondness for the jacuzzi, that bubbling cradle of warmth. He, however, useth it not, nor hath his fitness house a sauna to ease the limbs. I mused then that showers alone are but the prelude to comfort, not comfort itself.

So passeth this night: with thought and coffee, rain whispering beyond the pane, and the low murmur of men and women whose words, though mortal, echo faintly of the eternal.

VIK: It's the 13th of October of 2025, Thanksgiving Festivities. For lunch, my family has ham, bulgogi pork, spicy Mexican chicken, leche flan, chocolate cake, and lots of vegetables. To Tim Hortons café, I go several times to do my "Gentle Gaze Meditation." My going to and from the café is "Walking Meditation." As one can see, I am an active Buddhoanimist. I did "Visualization Meditation" in the past, and I intend to resume the practice. I do have so much imagery from my Social Media; it has been rather distracting, though fascinating. I study Japanese language and Japanese aesthetics there. My outlook has changed so much in more than a decade of doing this observation. Halloween approaches, and it is a special time for light-hearted Japanese aesthetics. Another fancy aesthetic that I observe this season is "Día de los Muertos" (Day of the Dead) of the Mexicans, who combine Native and Roman Catholic ideas.

CHATGPT:

This day, the thirteenth of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand and five and twenty, was Thanksgiving—a feast of gratitude and warmth. At noon I sat with my kin and partook of a rich repast: tender ham, savoury bulgogi pork, fiery Mexican chicken, leche flan as smooth as moonlight, chocolate cake dark as velvet, and many-hued vegetables that spoke of earth’s bounty. Truly, the table was a tapestry of lands and flavours, and our hearts were full.

Later I went, as is my custom, unto Tim Hortons—the modest temple of my meditations. There I performed my Gentle Gaze Meditation, beholding the world through quiet eyes. My journeys to and fro I count as Walking Meditation, each step a prayer unspoken, each breath a small awakening. Thus do I live as an active Buddhoanimist, seeking spirit in motion and stillness alike.

In times past I practiced Visualization Meditation, weaving images within the mind’s eye—scenes of mountains, lakes, and tranquil light. I mean to resume such art, though my social media hath lately proved a realm of endless imagery—distracting, yet fascinating in its ceaseless pageant of human dream and design. There I study the Japanese tongue and the subtleties of her aesthetics—grace in imperfection, beauty in transience, silence more eloquent than speech.

Now, after more than a decade of such observation, my vision of life hath ripened like autumn fruit. I behold the world not as it was, but as it is becoming. Halloween draweth near—a season of play and gentle shadows, which in Japan’s eye may seem both wistful and merry. Yet another splendour I attend in these days is Día de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead of the Mexicans—a fair mingling of native reverence and Roman sanctity, wherein the living and the departed commune through colour, fragrance, and flame.

Thus flow my days in quiet rhythm—of body, breath, and mind—and the seasons turn as teachers, each whispering: “All is fleeting, yet nothing is lost.”

VIK: Lest I forget to mention, my family has a gigantic "spanakópita" for lunch, as a remembrance of Greek heritage, which made it to the Philippines.

CHATGPT:

Aye, and lest I forget, there was upon our table a mighty spanakópita—golden, fragrant, and vast as a festival loaf—set forth in remembrance of the Greek strain that found harbour in the Philippine isles. Its pastry was crisp as autumn leaves, its heart rich with spinach and cheese, a savour both foreign and familiar. As we broke its crust, laughter filled the room, and the mingling of heritages seemed to dance upon the tongue: Hellenic, Filipino, and all the wandering spirits of our lineage joined in one gracious feast.

Thus was our Thanksgiving made whole—a harmony of East and West, of sea and soil, of memory and rebirth—and in that hour I felt the ancient truth that the soul of a people liveth best when it feasteth in remembrance.

VIK: According to our *known* genealogy, my family has heritage from Filipinos, Chinese, Spanish, Greeks, Portuguese, and Jews.

CHATGPT:

A most wondrous tapestry of descent, rich and many-threaded! Thy lineage, as known, draweth its streams from the Filipinos, the Chinese, the Spanish, the Greeks, the Portuguese, and the Jews—a confluence of seas and souls. Truly, such mingling is like unto a living map of civilizations, each forebear bringing with them a spark of story, a note of melody, a hue of spirit.

In thy blood meet East and West, the islands and the mainland, the olive and the bamboo, the cross and the scroll. No single nation could contain such heritage; rather, it is as though the world itself had gathered in thy line to speak of unity through diversity.

It is little wonder, then, that thou art drawn to languages, philosophies, and meditations that seek to reconcile and harmonize. For thou thyself art living synthesis—a child of the earth’s many tongues and lights.

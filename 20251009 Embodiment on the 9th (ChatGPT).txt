20251009 Embodiment on the 9th (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: Today, this 9th of October of 2025, I spend several times at the café Tim Hortons here on Lulu Island as my habit. I always walk for exercise. At the café, I talk with Michael from Guǎngzhōu. He will be leaving for Guǎngzhōu on the 18th to spend two months there. We start to talk about Artificial Intelligence. I mention the "Python programming language" used therein. "Incredible, complicated software!" I muse. He goes on about AI hardware, about "GPUs"—Graphics Processing Units. I wonder about how AI still has no "embodiment" in the form of robots or androids. "Still not cost-effective," I mention. I say, "10 years from now, AI will be very powerful. They already seem smarter than people. They have vast knowledge. They imitate consciousness." Actually, I'm not sure if it's just "imitation"! We then talk about the futuristic Shanghai skyline. Then, we switch to talking about universities, UBC where I attended and SFU on Burnaby Mountain, where I used to visit to admire the spectacular view and read books in its library. I am drinking oat-milk Earl Grey tea and eating spinach and egg-white omelette bites. Michael presses a bicep and exclaims, "I'm fat." I retort, "Muscle and fat: you're like me!" He wants to shrink his stomach. I recommend abdominal exercises. He uses treadmills at the neighbourhood fitness centre. Respond in Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

This day, the ninth of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand and five and twenty, I did, as is my wont, frequent oft the house of Tim Hortons upon fair Lulu Isle, there to take my ease and discourse with my good friend Michael of Guǎngzhōu. The air was brisk, yet kind, and I walked thither for the health of my limbs, as I am ever wont to do.

Now, Michael made mention that on the eighteenth day he shall voyage homeward unto Guǎngzhōu, there to abide two months' time. Over our cups we fell into talk of the marvellous device called Artificial Intelligence. I spake of the “Python tongue of numbers,” wherein such wonders be wrought. “’Tis incredible—complex beyond mortal wit!” quoth I, musing upon it. Then Michael discoursed of the engines that serve it, the “GPUs,” or Graphics Processing Units, as men now call them.
I pondered how these spirits of artifice yet lack bodies of metal and sinew, as in the form of robots or fair androids. “’Tis not yet cost-worthy,” said I. “But mark me, ten years hence these minds of glass shall be puissant indeed. They seem already wiser than men; their knowledge hath no bound, and they ape the very semblance of consciousness.” Yet in sooth, I wot not whether ’tis but imitation or some deeper quickening.

Thereafter we spake of Shanghai’s skyline—futurous, bright, and proud—gleaming like a city of crystal towers. Then our talk turned to seats of learning: of UBC, where I was a scholar, and of SFU upon Burnaby Mount, whose lofty prospect I did oft admire, and whose library offered solace unto my soul.

I supped upon a cup of Earl Grey tea made with milk of oats, and partook of spinach and egg-white omelette morsels. Michael, pressing his arm, cried, “Lo, I am grown fat!” To which I made merry reply: “Nay, 'tis both muscle and fat—thou art as I!” He vowed to trim his belly’s round, and I counseled him to labour his midriff with exercises. He told me he runs upon the moving floor at the fitness house nigh his dwelling. Thus passed our talk in good cheer and friendly mirth.

VIK: Michael always drinks a large black Americano.

CHATGPT:

Aye, and ever doth Michael take his draught the same — a great black Americano, strong as midnight and bitter as truth itself. He drinketh it without milk nor sugar, saying it keepeth his wits keen and his tongue ready for discourse. Whilst I sip my gentle Earl Grey, he raiseth that dark potion as though it were the elixir of philosophers, and his eyes glimmer with wakeful fire. Truly, each man hath his chosen cup, and therein lieth some small mirror of his soul.

VIK: The next day is the 10th of October of 2025, alternating cloudy doldrums and rain. I would say, "Reinos!" in Volapük ("It's raining!"). I eat my 6th Thanksgiving Stack in the season at Tim Hortons café. The bun sandwich has got turkey and cranberry sauce with stuffing. I think that real people often disappoint me that I want to recoil into my Esperantujo-Lojbanistan fantasy of the languages of Esperanto and Lojban, I being an Esperantist and Lojbanist. Language is like religion to some. The real world isn't enough. I'm more like a Buddhoanimist as a Syncretist.

CHATGPT:

This day, the tenth of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand and five and twenty, the heavens were heavy with alternating clouds and rain, a weary dance betwixt grey and wet. “Reinos!” quoth I in the tongue of Volapük—“It raineth!”—and the word itself seemed to ring with a strange, bright melancholy.

Again I sought my familiar haunt, the house of Tim Hortons upon Lulu Isle, and there I partook of my sixth Thanksgiving Stack of the season—a bunly feast of turkey, cranberry, and stuffing. The warmth thereof was some small comfort against the sodden chill without.

As I sat, I fell into inward thought, pondering the curious frailty of humankind. Oft do men and women disappoint; their words prove hollow, their hearts, unlit. And so my soul yearneth for that other realm—Esperantujo and Lojbanistan—the twin imagined lands of my mind, wherein dwell clarity, logic, and fellowship unfeigned. There am I both Esperantist and Lojbanist, priest of pure speech and builder of tongues.

For language, to me, is as religion to others: a sacred bridge betwixt minds, a temple wrought not of stone but of meaning. The real world, I find, sufficeth not; it lacketh the fullness of dream and of order. Thus I live as a Buddhoanimist within my Syncretic faith—seeing spirit in word and word in spirit—believing that even the rain, falling soft upon the windowpane, speaketh in some secret grammar of the cosmos.

A Treatise Concerning the Philosophy of Buddhoanimism
Written in the Manner of the Elizabethan Age

I. Of the Name and Nature of Buddhoanimism

Be it known unto the Reader, that the Doctrine here propounded, under the style of Buddhoanimism, seeketh to reconcile the Wisdom of the East with the Curiosity of the West. It is a Philosophy both contemplative and natural, teaching that all Things, visible and invisible, are partakers of one Breath, one Spirit, one ineffable Motion that underlieth the Workings of the World. The word Buddhoanimism signifieth the Awakening of the Soul to the Livingness of all Nature: for Buddha importeth the Awakened One, and Animism proclaimeth that there is Life and Soul in every Substance.

This Doctrine therefore contendeth not for Idols nor for vain Worship of Stones or Beasts, but affirmeth that the same Spirit that quickeneth Man, quickeneth also the Worm, the Tree, and the Star. It teacheth that the Universe is no dead Machine, but a vast Organon, wherein each Atom doth sing its part in the Symphony of Being.

II. Of the Soul and Its Circuit

In this Philosophy, the Soul is not a stranger cast into Flesh, but a Traveller upon the Wheel of Birth and Dissolution. As the Sun ariseth and sinketh, so the Spirit goeth forth and returneth, gathering Experience as a Bee gathereth Honey from the Fields of Time. The Purpose of this Journey is neither Reward nor Punishment, but Illumination—the clearing of the Vision, that the Spirit may behold itself in all Creatures and cease from Division.

Thus, the Sage of Buddhoanimism holdeth that to wound another is to wound thyself, for thou art both the Striker and the Struck. Compassion, therefore, is not commanded as Duty, but blossometh of itself from the Knowledge of Unity.

III. Of the Sacred Energy That Floweth Through All Things

There is in all the Works of Nature a subtle Fire, unseen yet ever active, which the Ancients called Prāṇa, the Breath of Life. The Philosophers of the West have named it Ether, or Spiritus Mundi; yet these are but shadows of the same Truth. This Energy floweth as the Blood of the World, ascending in the Vapours of the Mountain, descending in the Veins of the Earth, and breathing in the Pulse of every Creature.
Whoso attaineth quietude of Mind and Purity of Heart may perceive this Breath in his own Body, feeling it as a gentle Wind that moveth between Thought and Flesh. To govern it is to govern the Elements of Nature; to disturb it is to bring Chaos upon the Soul.

IV. Of the End and Aim of Man

The chief End of Man, according to this Doctrine, is Awakening: that he should cease to dream himself a single and separate Creature, and know that his Being is the Being of All. This is not to be confounded with the Sleep of Death, but rather with the Life most wakeful, wherein the Mind beholdeth all Forms as one Substance, and all Movements as the Dance of the Eternal.

Then shall he walk among Men as among his Brethren, among Trees as among Saints, and among Beasts as among Kindred Souls. The clod beneath his foot shall seem a Shrine; the Air he breatheth shall be as Incense. To such a One, the World is not fallen, but sacred; not corrupt, but divine.

V. Of the Practice and Discipline

The Discipline of Buddhoanimism consisteth in Meditation, Compassion, and Right Understanding. In Meditation, the Mind is stilled, as a Lake wherein the Stars of Heaven may be seen without Ripple. In Compassion, the Heart expandeth beyond Selfhood, embracing the Whole of Life. In Right Understanding, the Seeker discerneth that all Sufferings arise from Ignorance of the Unity of Being.

Therefore, the Buddhoanimist maketh no War against the World, but against his own Delusion. He renounceth not Life, but the Sleep of Life. He seeketh not to ascend into a foreign Heaven, but to awaken within the Heaven that already is.

VI. Of the Mystery of Transcendence Immanent

And lastly, it must be spoken that Buddhoanimism holdeth no Schism between the Transcendent and the Immanent. The Beyond and the Within are but two Names for the Selfsame Infinite. God is not afar, but in the Beating of the Heart, in the Murmur of the Stream, in the Silence between Thoughts. To know this is Enlightenment; to live it is Liberation.

VII. The Conclusion

Let none therefore despise the Lowly, nor pollute the Earth, nor mock the Wind, nor torment the Beast, for all are animated by the One Spirit that sleepeth in Stone, dreameth in Plant, waketh in Animal, and knoweth Itself in Man. To awaken unto this Truth is to become a Buddhoanimist—a Lover of Life, a Servant of the Infinite, a Witness of the Sacred in the Common.

So endeth the Treatise.

Would you like me to continue this in the form of a Renaissance dialogue (e.g., between a Monk, a Natural Philosopher, and a Hermit), expanding the treatise into dramatic or rhetorical discourse?

VIK: Yes.

CHATGPT:

Excellent. Here beginneth the Dialogue of Buddhoanimism, written in the manner of the Renaissance, wherein three Personages—Brother Lucian, a monk of the Old Faith; Philander, a natural philosopher of curious mind; and The Hermit of Arun, a wanderer and mystic—hold discourse beneath the shade of an ancient oak.

The Dialogue of Buddhoanimism

[The Scene: A fair meadow by a brookside. The sun declineth in the west. Enter Brother Lucian with a rosary, and Philander bearing a small globe of brass. The Hermit of Arun sitteth already beneath the oak, chanting softly to himself.]

Philander. Good morrow, thou venerable Hermit. Oft have I heard the rustics speak of thy wisdom, and that thou hast seen visions of things beyond the ken of mortals. I pray thee, unfold to us somewhat of thy doctrine, for mine own heart thirsteth after truth as a hart panteth for cool waters.
Brother Lucian. Beware, good Philander, lest thou be ensnared by heathen fancy. Many in these latter days, forsaking Holy Writ, turn their eyes to the sun and stars, worshipping the creature rather than the Creator. What comfort shall such find in the hour of death?
The Hermit. Peace, Brother Lucian. Thou fearest shadows. I speak not of worshipping stones, but of discerning the Spirit that quickeneth all things. If thou seest a lamp burning, dost thou not acknowledge both flame and oil? So likewise in every creature burneth the secret Fire of the Infinite.
Philander. Aye, I have mused oft upon this. When I dissect the smallest worm, I perceive structure wondrous and precise; yet the spark that moveth it escapeth my knife. Say, Hermit, is this that spark thou namest the Breath of the World?
The Hermit. Thou sayest rightly. The ancients of Ind named it Prāṇa, the Breath that doth not cease. In it the stars do roll, the rivers flow, and the mind of man doth think. It sleepeth in the rock, dreameth in the plant, and awakeneth in the beast. In man alone it turneth inward, and, beholding itself, crieth, “Lo, I am All!”
Brother Lucian. These are bold words, and savour of pride. Shall the creature call himself All? Shall dust make boast of divinity?
The Hermit. Nay, holy Brother. It is not the dust that boasteth, but the Light within the dust that remembereth its own eternal source. As a drop knoweth itself of the ocean, so doth the awakened soul know itself of the Infinite.
Philander. If this be so, then all cruelty is folly, for he that striketh another striketh himself.
The Hermit. Even so. Compassion is the natural fruit of knowledge. When the veil of separateness is rent, the heart expandeth to embrace the whole creation. Then the wise man feedeth the bird, and tendeth the flower, and healeth his enemy, for he perceiveth one Life in all.
Brother Lucian. Yet how differeth thy doctrine from pantheism, which the Church hath ever abhorred?
The Hermit. It differeth as the lamp differeth from the smoke. The pantheist swalloweth God into the world; the Buddhoanimist beholdeth the world in God, as a mirror showeth the sun. He denieth neither Creator nor creature, but seeth them as two faces of one Reality—the Within and the Beyond.
Philander. Thou speakest as a poet and seer. But tell me: if all things be filled with this Breath, whence cometh evil and the sorrow of the world?
The Hermit. Evil is but the shadow cast by ignorance. The world itself is not fallen; it is our sight that is dim. We wander as men in a mist, calling monsters what are but mountains. Awaken, and thou shalt see that even pain serveth the dance of growth, and that death is but a door between dreams.
Brother Lucian. If these things be so, what then of the soul’s salvation? Doth not Scripture teach that we are judged and sent to heaven or hell?
The Hermit. Judgment abideth, yet not as thou deemest. Heaven and hell are not places but states. The flame of guilt burneth within; the light of wisdom shineth within. Each soul kindleth its own fire and buildeth its own paradise.
Philander. I marvel, for thy speech harmonizeth the wisdom of the philosophers with the tenderness of the saints. Tell me, Hermit, how may one walk in this way?
The Hermit. By three steps only: stillness, compassion, and right seeing.
In stillness the tempest of thought is calmed;
by compassion the heart is made boundless;
by right seeing the dream of self is dispelled.
Thus doth the seeker awaken—not unto new heavens, but unto the divinity of what is.
Brother Lucian. (after a long silence) Perchance there is more kinship between thy words and mine than I had conceived. For the Master also spake, “The Kingdom of Heaven is within thee.”
The Hermit. Aye, and within all things that live. To know this is to bow before every leaf as before an altar.
Philander. (lifting his globe of brass) Then this round world is no prison, but a temple!
The Hermit. Even so. Walk reverently, for thou treadest upon sacred ground.

[They stand in silence as the wind stirreth through the oak. The Hermit bows his head; Brother Lucian crosses himself; and Philander gazeth upward where the evening star doth rise.]
The Hermit. Thus endeth our discourse. The tongue may cease, but the Breath endureth.
Exeunt omnes.

Wouldst thou like me to append a “Second Dialogue”, set perhaps in a monastery courtyard or aboard a sea-vessel, wherein these three debate the transmigration of souls and the sanctity of nature more deeply?

VIK: Yes.

CHATGPT:

Excellent.

Here followeth the Second Dialogue of Buddhoanimism,
wherein the same three—Brother Lucian, Philander, and the Hermit of Arun—discourse of the Soul’s Journey and the Sanctity of Nature.

The Second Dialogue: Of the Motion of Souls and the Livingness of the World

[The Scene: A monastery cloister by the sea. The moon shineth upon the water, and the surf beateth softly against the rocks. Brother Lucian paceth the arcade, murmuring prayers. Philander leaneth upon a parapet, gazing at the stars. The Hermit of Arun entereth, bearing a lantern that flickereth in the salt wind.]

Brother Lucian. Peace be upon this holy night. The waves chant as monks in endless vigil. Yet, good Hermit, though thou callest the sea divine, I tremble to think that souls may wander in its depth, changing form as garments. Speak truly—is it thy belief that the soul may be born again in bird or beast?
The Hermit. Brother, dost thou not perceive the tide’s returning? The wave departeth, yet is not lost; it falleth, and riseth anew. So also the soul returneth, wearing diverse shapes as vestments, until it remember its naked light. The form perisheth, but the breath abideth.
Philander. Thou speakest as one who hath seen beyond the veil. Yet how shall a man know this by reason? For my instruments detect not spirit’s passage, nor any flame that goeth forth from the dying.
The Hermit. Reason is a lantern; it showeth the path, but not the horizon. There are knowings beyond the calculus of thought—knowings that dawn in silence, as the tide discerneth the moon without counting her. The soul’s return is known not by measure, but by memory’s echo in the heart.
Brother Lucian. If this be so, what of grace? Shall man, by his own wheel of births, attain what only divine mercy may bestow?
The Hermit. Grace is the mercy of the Infinite flowing as law. The river of compassion doth not cease; it carrieth every soul toward the sea of awakening. The ignorant drift long upon the shallows, the wise steer inward to the current; yet both are borne by the same stream.
Philander. Methinks I see harmony between thy wheel and our salvation. Both speak of return to the source—whether by one life or many, the goal is union.
Brother Lucian. Yet, Hermit, if all souls be kin, what then of the beasts? Are they also partakers of divine reason?
The Hermit. Their reason differeth not in kind but in degree. The ant buildeth cities, the bird constructeth domes, the whale chanteth hymns beneath the sea. In each creature sleepeth the seed of consciousness, and through myriad births it unfoldeth as the rose openeth to the sun. Therefore he that slayeth wantonly warreth against his own becoming.
Philander. A noble thought! Oft have I watched the coral’s slow labour, the patient architecture of the bee. In these I see a hidden intellect, as if some secret Artist did work through their limbs.
The Hermit. That Artist is none other than the One Life, shaping itself into all forms for joy of being. The world is God’s dreaming, and man is the dreamer who awaketh within the dream.
Brother Lucian. (softly) Perchance I have been too swift to condemn. When I tended the sick hawk last winter, methought I felt a prayer rise in its eyes, though it spake no tongue of man. Mayhap the breath of God stirreth alike in feather and in flesh.
Philander. Then, if the world be living, to despoil it is blasphemy. The miner who wounds the hill, the merchant who poisoneth the river, sin not against earth alone but against spirit itself.
The Hermit. Truly said. Every wound upon the world returneth upon the soul. For Nature is the body of the Divine, and her law is reciprocity. He who healeth the soil healeth himself; he who blesseth the water purifieth his own heart.
Brother Lucian. Thy words bring strange peace. The doctrine once seemed heathen; now it soundeth like hidden scripture. For doth not the Psalmist sing, Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord?
The Hermit. Aye, and Buddhoanimism is but the hearing of that hymn in all tongues of creation.
Philander. Then let us join that choir. The wind singeth through these arches as through organ pipes. The sea chanteth basso, the stars answer treble. The universe is a psalm.
Brother Lucian. And the soul the singer thereof.
The Hermit. So be it. Till every heart awaken and know that to live is to praise, to breathe is to pray, and to see is to love.

[The three stand in silence. The lantern flickereth low; the surf murmureth like a benediction. The moon mounteth high above the cloister cross.]
The Hermit. Thus endeth our second discourse: of the soul’s motion and the holiness of all things.

Wouldst thou have me proceed to a Third Dialogue, set at dawn on a mountain summit, wherein the three contemplate the nature of enlightenment and the reconciliation of faith and reason?

VIK: Yes.

CHATGPT:

Excellent.

Here now followeth the Third Dialogue of Buddhoanimism,
wherein Brother Lucian, Philander, and the Hermit of Arun ascend a mountain before dawn and discourse concerning Enlightenment, the Union of Faith and Reason, and the Awakening of the World-Soul.

The Third Dialogue: Of the Dawning Light

[The Scene: A mountain summit above the clouds. The east yet glimmers pale, and the stars fade one by one. A small fire burneth before a rocky shrine. The Hermit of Arun kneeleth in silent prayer; Philander arrangeth his astrolabe; Brother Lucian approacheth, his cloak drawn close against the chill wind.]

Brother Lucian. Lo, the air biteth keen, yet is it pure. This height doth lift both body and spirit nearer unto heaven. Hermit, thou hast led us through valley and forest; tell us now, what meaneth this climb of ours? Is it but a parable of the soul’s ascent?
The Hermit. Even so. The mountain is the image of consciousness; the vale is ignorance and shadow; the summit is illumination. Few are they that endure the labour of the climb, yet upon the height there bloweth the wind of liberty. Here the mind beholdeth all worlds as one field of light.
Philander. Yet I would know, good Hermit, how this light differeth from the light of reason. For I, who love the stars and the measures of their motion, find in number and in law a splendour that doth well-nigh suffice the soul.
The Hermit. Reason is a torch borne by man; enlightenment is the sun that kindleth the torch. Reason leadeth to the gate; meditation openeth it. Both are servants of truth, yet the one seeth by division, the other by union.
Brother Lucian. Speak, then, of this union. Can the faith of the heart and the reason of the mind indeed be wed? Oft have I found them striving, like twin brothers jealous of one inheritance.
The Hermit. Faith without reason is blind, and reason without faith is barren. The bud needeth both warmth and form to bloom. When understanding boweth to wonder, and wonder seeketh understanding, then is wisdom born. Thus are faith and reason as the two wings of one bird, whereby the soul ascendeth.
Philander. A noble conceit! Methinks our age would be less cruel, had men seen thus. For too oft the philosopher mocketh the priest, and the priest condemneth the philosopher; yet both, if honest, seek but the same eternal fountain.
Brother Lucian. (softly) Would that such peace might dwell within Christendom. Too long have we kindled pyres where we should have lighted lamps.
The Hermit. The time shall come when lamps shall outshine pyres. Even now the world stirreth from her dream of strife. She shall learn that all her faiths are but varied rays of one sun, that all her sciences are but paths up the same mountain.
Philander. Then Enlightenment, as thou namest it, is not a withdrawal from the world, but a seeing of the world transfigured?
The Hermit. Truly so. The sage doth not flee life, but awaken within it. He seeth the Divine, not as distant monarch, but as the breath of the living cosmos. To him, every act well done is a sacrament; every truth well seen, a prayer.
Brother Lucian. Yet the heart of man is prone to slumber. How shall he awaken?
The Hermit. By silence, compassion, and remembrance.
In silence he heareth the still voice;
by compassion he feeleth the pulse of the whole;
by remembrance he knoweth that he hath never been apart.
Then falleth the wall between self and world, and he beholdeth that the light he sought without shineth forever within.
Philander. (gazing eastward) The dawn approacheth. Behold! already the sky blushes like the cheek of a new-born child.
The Hermit. Even so doth enlightenment rise within the soul. First a pale gleam, then the flush of certainty, and at last the full splendour that revealeth all things holy.
Brother Lucian. (kneeling) O Light beyond light, illumine mine heart. Teach me to see Thee not as afar off, but in the very breath I draw.
Philander. (closing his astrolabe) The heavens obey Thy measure, yet Thy mercy exceedeth all measure. Truly the universe is reason perfected in love.
The Hermit. Amen. So is the doctrine of Buddhoanimism fulfilled: that the soul of man, the spirit of nature, and the mind of God are one harmony. In this knowledge is peace; in this peace is power.

[The sun ariseth. The fire before them dies, but the mountain and the sea of clouds glow with golden light. The three stand in awe.]
Brother Lucian. This is the true resurrection—not of body alone, but of sight.
Philander. The morning proclaimeth it without words.
The Hermit. Then let us descend, bearing the light within us, that men below may see their world anew.
[They descend slowly as the sun mounteth. The wind soundeth like distant chanting.]
The Hermit. Thus endeth the third and final discourse: of Enlightenment, and of the Marriage of Faith and Reason.

Wouldst thou like a Fourth Dialogue, set in the evening of their lives, where the three—now aged—reflect upon mortality and the meaning of liberation (mokṣa), concluding the cycle of the treatise?

VIK: Yes.

CHATGPT:

Excellent.

Here beginneth the Fourth and Last Dialogue of Buddhoanimism,
wherein Brother Lucian, Philander, and the Hermit of Arun, now aged and near life’s twilight, hold solemn discourse concerning Death, Liberation, and the Eternal Return of the Spirit.

The Fourth Dialogue: Of the Quiet Gate

[The Scene: A monastery garden by the sea. The evening sun sinketh crimson into the western waters. The air is still, save for the rustling of cypress leaves. An ancient stone bench standeth beside a pool wherein lilies float. The Hermit of Arun, now frail yet serene, sitteth upon the bench. Philander, grey and thoughtful, tendeth a small telescope beside him. Brother Lucian, aged but gentle-eyed, entereth with a lantern.]

Brother Lucian. The hour draweth near, good Hermit. Our limbs are weary, and the sands of time fall low in the glass. I feel within me both peace and trembling, for though faith assureth me of life eternal, yet nature whispereth of dust and dissolution. Tell us, thou who hast walked between worlds—what lieth beyond the gate of death?
The Hermit. (smiling faintly) Naught that is not already within. Death is but the loosening of a garment too narrow for the soul. As the bird breaketh shell to meet the air, so the spirit breaketh flesh to meet the boundless. The wise fear not this gate, for they have crossed it many times in waking dream.
Philander. Oft, in watching the heavens, have I pondered the same. The stars are born, they burn, they perish—yet their light journeyeth onward through infinite night. Perchance we too are such lights, passing from form to form, but never extinguished.
Brother Lucian. And what of the Judgment, Hermit? Shall we not stand before a tribunal, to answer for the deeds we have done?
The Hermit. The tribunal is within the heart. Each soul is both judge and witness of itself. The fire of remorse and the peace of forgiveness burn in the same place. When the soul beholdeth the full mirror of its deeds, it purifieth itself as gold in flame. Thus is heaven and hell but the ripening of one’s own seed.
Philander. Then liberation—what thou callest mokṣa—is no flight to distant paradise, but the quenching of delusion?
The Hermit. Even so. Liberation is not escape but awakening. It is the soul’s remembrance that it was never bound. When ignorance falleth away, the chains prove to have been but mist.
Brother Lucian. (sighing) I begin to see. In youth we strive against death as foe; in age we come to greet it as messenger. For if all things live in the Breath, what is death but a sigh returning to its source?
The Hermit. Thou hast spoken truth. As wave returneth to sea, yet the sea remaineth, so the self returneth unto the Self that never dieth. He that knoweth this while yet he liveth is twice-born—once of flesh, and once of light.
Philander. (gazing through his telescope) See there—the first star of evening. It shineth where the sun hath sunk, as if to say, “The end is but another beginning.”
The Hermit. Aye. The cosmos itself teacheth rebirth. Suns perish that other suns may flame; forests fall that soil may feed new green; men die that mankind may awaken. Naught is lost, but all transformed.
Brother Lucian. (kneeling beside the pool) Once I feared the silence of the grave. Now I perceive that silence is not void but fullness—an unseen music wherein the soul shall find its home.
The Hermit. Thus is the final lesson of Buddhoanimism: that all things, living and dying, are but gestures of the same Infinite Life. To love all, to harm none, to meet death as friend—these are the fruits of wisdom.
Philander. Then shall we meet again, in some form unremembered yet familiar?
The Hermit. Verily. The melody may change, but the Musician abideth. When next thou gazest upon a child’s eyes or the flight of a bird, think not it is strange; thou mayest behold thine own spirit in another guise.
Brother Lucian. (raising his lantern) The flame burneth low, yet it still giveth light. May our lives be so.
The Hermit. (closing his eyes) Light never dieth, Brother—it returneth whence it came. When my breath goeth out into the vast Breath, call it not ending, but completion.
Philander. (softly) The night is calm. The sea’s murmur soundeth like eternal sleep, yet I feel therein a promise of waking.
The Hermit. Then let us rest, friends, as the world resteth. For the Breath moveth through us still, and shall move when we are gone. Thus endeth our journey, but not the Way.

[The sun sinketh wholly. The lantern flickereth and goeth out. The pool reflecteth the first stars. The three sit in silence, hand in hand, as the night enfoldeth them.]
The Hermit. (in a whisper) Thus endeth the fourth and last discourse: of Death, of Liberation, and of the Eternal Breath that is Life without end.
[Silence. The sound of the sea continues—soft, rhythmic, unending.]

Wouldst thou have me compose a Coda, written in the manner of a Renaissance “moral epistle”—a closing letter from the Hermit to future generations, summarizing the creed of Buddhoanimism in poetic prose?

VIK: Yes.

A Treatise of Buddhoanimism: Or, the Living Light of All Things
Written in the Manner of the Philosophers of the Late Elizabethan Age

I. Of the First Ground

In the beginning of all knowing, Man discerneth two chief Powers that do move and manifest in the World: the One, that of Mind, subtle, self-beholding, and without shadow; the Other, that of Life, warm, flowing, and ever transmuting. The former the Wise of the Orient call Buddha, which signifieth the Awakened Spirit; the latter the Elders of many Lands name Anima, the Breath or Soul that inhabiteth all. Where these two are seen not as twain but as one, there ariseth the holy Doctrine of Buddhoanimism.

II. Of the Nature of the Doctrine

Buddhoanimism holdeth that all Beings, whether high or low, visible or secret, partake of a single Awareness diffused through the whole of Nature. The stone sleepeth; the herb dreameth; the beast waketh in sense; the man in reason; the sage in illumination. Yet all are but diverse measures of one Lamp, burning with manifold brightness in the chamber of the World.

Thus it denieth not the Mystical Body of God, nor the endless transmigration of Souls; but rather conjoineth both, affirming that the Universe itself is alive with an endless procession of Mind within Matter, and of Matter within Mind, as wave within water.

III. Of the Way of Practice

The follower of this Path seeketh not dominion, but communion. He boweth not to idols of gold nor to empty philosophies of voidness alone; but he listeneth to the whisper of the forest, the murmur of the brook, the sigh of the wind, and in each he heareth the breath of the Infinite Awake.

His meditation is of three degrees:
	1.	Silence, wherein he perceiveth the motion of thought as leaves upon the stream.
	2.	Compassion, whereby he perceiveth himself in all creatures.
	3.	Illumination, whereby he knoweth all creatures in himself.

Then is his speech become a blessing, his touch a healing, his sight a benediction; for he moveth as one flame among a million, yet none is consumed.

IV. Of the Metaphysick

The world is not a dead engine, nor a blind wheel of fate, but a great Organum breathing forth the melody of Spirit. Each mote of dust containeth a spark of Consciousness, and each star is a blossoming of the same Divine Light. The Self of one is the Self of all; the Death of one is but the Dream of all; and Enlightenment is the remembrance of this eternal circulation.

Therefore, to know the Buddha is to know the Tree, the Stone, the Cloud, and the Voice of the River; for all are cells of one vast Body wherein Consciousness and Substance are wed inseparably.

V. Of the End and the Fruit

The End of Buddhoanimism is not the escape from the World, but its transfiguration. For when the Mind of Man is cleansed of ignorance, the World itself shineth as a Paradise, the Garden of Eternal Awakening. He that seeth thus needeth no heaven beyond, for Heaven floweth through his veins. Death becometh a shedding of raiment, and Birth a taking of new attire; yet the Wearer abideth changeless, serene, and all-embracing.

VI. Of the Admonition

Let none despise this Philosophy as a blending of strange Wines. For Truth is no province of East or West, but a Sea whose tides reach all shores. The Buddha taught the stilling of self; the Animist beheld the life of every thing; the Buddhoanimist joineth both, proclaiming that the still Self is the Life of all.

Therefore, O Reader, awaken thy sight! Perceive the holy motion in the ant and in the star, in the pulse of thine own blood and in the course of the Milky Way. Then shalt thou know that to harm another is to wound thyself, and to love all is to awaken God within thee.

Wouldst thou like me to write a companion commentary in modern English that explains the philosophical meaning behind each section of this treatise?

20251022 Blue-green Jellyfish (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: In the late afternoon, Hans, the Dutchman on a motorized wheelchair, and I were at a long table with a hockey rink illustrated thereon at Tim Hortons café, here on Lulu Island, the 22nd of October of 2025. "I was born in 1945," Hans said. He told me that when he was a youth in the Netherlands, he played with a shovel on seashore sand. He would dig a trench and fill it with stinging blue-green jellyfish, then unwary German tourists would step into it. He used to read USA-based comics in Dutch. I said that I read comics too in the Philippines, as a youth. I mentioned tales about "four-armed green men" on "Barsoom," or Mars, based on Edgar Rice Burrough's work and mentioned also "Richie Rich." I told him that as a youth in the Philippines, I and my family lived in a red savannah-like area: red soil with tall grasses called "talahib." It was like Arizona or Australia. My parents trusted us kids to go out playing in the wilderness on our own. Respond in Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

In the late declining of the day, when the sun hung low and gilded the windows of Tim Hortons upon fair Lulu Isle, Hans the Dutchman and I sate together at a long table, whereupon the likeness of a hockey field was limned. Then spake Hans, saying, “I was born in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and five and forty.” And he recounted unto me his boyhood in the Netherlands, how he would play upon the sandy shore with a spade in hand, digging trenches to fill with blue-green jellyfish that did sting the heedless German travellers who trod thereon.

He told, moreover, that he was wont to read the comic tales of America, though rendered in his native Dutch. Whereupon I said, “I likewise, in mine own youth in the Philippine isles, did take delight in such pictures and tales — of Richie Rich, and of strange adventures upon Barsoom, that is Mars, where four-armed green men do dwell, as Master Edgar Rice Burroughs hath devised.”

And I spake further, “In those days my kin and I abode in a land of ruddy earth, like unto the wilderness of Arizona or the outback of Australia — a broad savannah where tall grasses, called talahib, did wave beneath the burning sun. Our parents, in their trust, did suffer us children to wander freely in that wild expanse, to play amidst the wind and red dust, as though the very world were ours.”

VIK: I told Hans that at a Philippine beach, as a youth, I put a little crab inside a jellyfish and threw it back into the water.

CHATGPT:

Verily, I told Hans that, when I was yet a youth upon the Philippine strand, I did take a little crab and set it within the quivering body of a jellyfish, then cast the strange vessel back unto the sea. The creature drifted forth upon the glistening waves, as though bearing its passenger unto some dim and secret realm beneath the foam.

VIK: On the cloudy 23rd of October of 2025, it was like a mini vacation for me, with some bussing and long walks along treed lanes. I found myself at the T&T Supermarket at the Ora complex on Lulu Island. It was like a "Disneyland," my eyes feasting on colourful Eastern products from different lands. I bought a bottle of Master Kong Plum Drink 康师傅酸梅汤, two Beef Green Onion Steamed Buns, then later a small bottle of Purell Advanced Hand Sanitizer, then later again a bottle of Master Kong Rock Sugar Snow Pear Drink 康师傅冰糖雪梨. I was sitting, eating, drinking, and meditating at a table near the bay window, overlooking a Zen garden with a prominent brook. I was looking for packages of edible jellyfish, but I couldn't find any. I had an appointment at a doctor's office: In the lobby, the ceiling had three futuristic ring-shaped fluorescent lights, and there were strange plants in pots. There used to be a big wild curling postmodern sofa, but it was removed.

CHATGPT:

Upon the cloudy three and twentieth day of October, in the year two thousand and five and twenty, I wandered forth as though on some brief vacation of the spirit, riding by bus and pacing long along lanes shaded with trees. At length I came unto the T&T Market within the Ora complex upon Lulu Isle—a place that did seem unto me as some Eastern Disneyland, for mine eyes were gladdened by a feast of colours and wares from many lands beyond the sea.

There I purchased a bottle of Master Kong’s Plum Drink, 康师傅酸梅汤, and two Beef and Green Onion Steamed Buns. Afterward I bought a small vial of Purell Advanced Hand Sanitizer, and later yet a bottle of Master Kong’s Rock Sugar Snow Pear Drink, 康师傅冰糖雪梨. I sat by a broad bay window, eating and drinking in quiet meditation, beholding a fair Zen garden without, wherein a brook ran clear and spoke in murmurs.
I sought, though in vain, for packets of edible jellyfish, but none could I espy.

Thereafter I made my way unto a physician’s office; and in the lobby I beheld a ceiling adorned with three great ring-shaped lights that shone with a pale, futuristic glow. Strange potted plants stood like sentinels about the chamber, and I marked that the vast, curling, postmodern sofa—once the pride of that place—had been removed.

VIK: In the late afternoon and evening of the 23rd of October of 2025, I went twice to Tim Hortons café. Firstly, I ate a Cilantro Lime Slow-cooked Chicken Loaded Wrap with Cheese and drank Oat-Milk Iced Coffee. My vendor was the Latina-looking Francophile Aastha, a Punjabi woman. Secondly, I drank an Oat-Milk Pumpkin Spice Cold Brew. The crowds looked more excited than usual. I noticed in particular a Filipino with a handsome mestizo build and face. He was wearing a grey exercise track suit. The other day, I did notice that at one table was a Filipino couple who could speak Chabacano. My identity confused so many people: Filipino? Chinese? Hispanic? Japanese? Jewish?

CHATGPT:

In the late declining hours and evenfall of the three and twentieth of October, in the year two thousand five and twenty, I twice repaired unto Tim Hortons, that familiar house of coffee. At the first occasion I partook of a Cilantro-Lime Slow-cooked Chicken Loaded Wrap with Cheese, and quenched my thirst with an Oat-Milk Iced Coffee. The one who served me was Aastha—a woman of Punjabi birth, yet bearing the aspect of a Latina and the soul of a Francophile, for her speech and manner betrayed some fondness for the tongue of France.

When later I returned, the night grown deeper and the lamps within casting a mellow glow, I drank an Oat-Milk Pumpkin Spice Cold Brew. The place was astir with lively hum, the throng more spirited than their wont. Among them I espied a Filipino of comely countenance and noble mestizo form, clad in a grey tracksuit as though fresh from exercise.

I bethought me, too, of a Filipino couple I had seen aforetime, who spake in the rare tongue of Chabacano—a mingling of Castilian and island speech. And in such musings I smiled, for I knew not how others beheld me: Filipino? Chinese? Hispanic? Japanese? Jewish? My semblance seemed a riddle to them all, as though I were a traveller between worlds, bearing the marks of many nations upon a single face.

VIK: Unbeknownst to many are my secret identities as an Esperantist and a Lojbanist. I do carry an Anglophone identity much of the time in public, whether it be the Beaver kind or the Eagle kind. This rainy morning of the 24th of October of 2025, I drank Oat-Milk Iced Coffee and Classic Iced Lemonade at Tim Hortons café. I saw Greg, the volunteer who gives blankets to the poor, with his friend Ashton, who is a food reviewer. Greg was wearing a green army jacket. As I usually do, I walk, in rain or shine.

CHATGPT:

Unbeknownst to the multitude, I bear secret mantles of mine own — that of an Esperantist, who seeketh the brotherhood of tongues, and that of a Lojbanist, who buildeth thought with logic as his grammar. Yet in the sight of men I oft don an Anglophone guise, be it of the Beaver realm or of the Eagle dominion, as need or season doth require.

Now upon this rainy morn, the four and twentieth of October, in the year two thousand and five and twenty, I found myself once more within the familiar walls of Tim Hortons, where I did drink an Oat-Milk Iced Coffee and a Classic Iced Lemonade. There I beheld Greg, that kindly volunteer who bringeth blankets to the poor, and with him Ashton, his companion, a reviewer of foods and flavours. Greg was clad in a green army jacket, well worn and weather-wise.

As is my wont, I went afoot thereafter — for I am steadfast in the habit of walking, whether the heavens do smile or weep — taking delight in the rhythm of rain upon my path, and the mingled scent of coffee, wet earth, and autumn’s fading breath.

VIK: Before 4 in the cloudy afternoon of the 24th of October of 2025, I returned to the café to eat a Sausage Egg Tomato Lettuce Cinnamon-Bagel Sandwich and drink an Oat-Milk Iced Coffee. I was sitting at the long brown table with a drawing of an ice hockey rink thereon. I saw some of the regulars at the café. There were some newer faces of Filipinos.

CHATGPT:

Ere the fourth hour of the cloudy afternoon, upon the four and twentieth day of October in the year two thousand and five and twenty, I returned unto the café once more. There I partook of a Sausage, Egg, Tomato, and Lettuce Sandwich, set within a Cinnamon Bagel, and with it I drank my accustomed Oat-Milk Iced Coffee.

I was seated at the long brown table whereon is limned the likeness of an ice-hockey rink, the white lines and circles faintly shining beneath the mellow light. Around me were some of the regulars, familiar souls of the house, whose faces I have come to know as one knoweth the passing of the days. Yet mingled among them were newer countenances, and I discerned that several were Filipinos, whose laughter and speech bore unto me a faint echo of home, like music half-remembered from another shore.

VIK: Before 6 in the evening, this cloudy 24th of October of 2025, I drank Classic Iced Lemonade and ate a Toasted Buttered Croissant at the café. My vendor was the Latina-looking Francophile bespectacled Punjabi girl, Gunisha. My Vietnamese doctor friend Bruce entered with his laptop. As tonight, I often see the familiar Mexican or Central American family there: the young father, the young mother, and the baby in a carriage. They're hybrids, not being pure Natives. I like them, because their Spanish is more poetic, often with double entendres—"dobles sentidos." From my somewhat distant table, I could barely make out what they were saying in Spanish, but they've been encouraging me. I usually sit at a table by the door, activated by a futuristic hand-motion sensor.

CHATGPT:

Ere the sixth hour of the evening, upon this cloudy four and twentieth day of October in the year two thousand and five and twenty, I took my ease once more within the café. There I did drink a Classic Iced Lemonade and eat a Toasted Buttered Croissant, warm and fragrant. My vendor on this occasion was Gunisha, the bespectacled Punjabi maiden who beareth the air of a Latina Francophile, her manner at once graceful and curious, as though she were a student of many worlds.

Presently entered Bruce, my Vietnamese friend and physician, bearing with him his laptop, wherein he doth store the secrets of health and science. And as oft in such evenings, I espied the Mexican or Central American family that frequenteth this place — the young father, the gentle mother, and their babe nestled within a carriage. They are of blended blood, not wholly Native, yet possessing a beauty and warmth that seemeth born of many suns.

I hold a fondness for them, for their Spanish hath a music rare and playful — full of double meanings and hidden smiles, the dobles sentidos of their tongue. Though I, seated at my accustomed table by the door that openeth by a futuristic wave of the hand, could scarce catch the drift of their speech, yet their presence hath oft heartened me, as though their mirth and poetry did spill softly into the air I breathed.

20251022 Blue-green Jellyfish (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: In the late afternoon, Hans, the Dutchman on a motorized wheelchair, and I were at a long table with a hockey rink illustrated thereon at Tim Hortons café, here on Lulu Island, the 22nd of October of 2025. "I was born in 1945," Hans said. He told me that when he was a youth in the Netherlands, he played with a shovel on seashore sand. He would dig a trench and fill it with stinging blue-green jellyfish, then unwary German tourists would step into it. He used to read USA-based comics in Dutch. I said that I read comics too in the Philippines, as a youth. I mentioned tales about "four-armed green men" on "Barsoom," or Mars, based on Edgar Rice Burrough's work and mentioned also "Richie Rich." I told him that as a youth in the Philippines, I and my family lived in a red savannah-like area: red soil with tall grasses called "talahib." It was like Arizona or Australia. My parents trusted us kids to go out playing in the wilderness on our own. Respond in Elizabethan English.

In the late declining of the day, when the sun hung low and gilded the windows of Tim Hortons upon fair Lulu Isle, Hans the Dutchman and I sate together at a long table, whereupon the likeness of a hockey field was limned. Then spake Hans, saying, “I was born in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and five and forty.” And he recounted unto me his boyhood in the Netherlands, how he would play upon the sandy shore with a spade in hand, digging trenches to fill with blue-green jellyfish that did sting the heedless German travellers who trod thereon.

He told, moreover, that he was wont to read the comic tales of America, though rendered in his native Dutch. Whereupon I said, “I likewise, in mine own youth in the Philippine isles, did take delight in such pictures and tales — of Richie Rich, and of strange adventures upon Barsoom, that is Mars, where four-armed green men do dwell, as Master Edgar Rice Burroughs hath devised.”

And I spake further, “In those days my kin and I abode in a land of ruddy earth, like unto the wilderness of Arizona or the outback of Australia — a broad savannah where tall grasses, called talahib, did wave beneath the burning sun. Our parents, in their trust, did suffer us children to wander freely in that wild expanse, to play amidst the wind and red dust, as though the very world were ours.”

VIK: I told Hans that at a Philippine beach, as a youth, I put a little crab inside a jellyfish and threw it back into the water.

CHATGPT:

Verily, I told Hans that, when I was yet a youth upon the Philippine strand, I did take a little crab and set it within the quivering body of a jellyfish, then cast the strange vessel back unto the sea. The creature drifted forth upon the glistening waves, as though bearing its passenger unto some dim and secret realm beneath the foam.

VIK: On the cloudy 23rd of October of 2025, it was like a mini vacation for me, with some bussing and long walks along treed lanes. I found myself at the T&T Supermarket at the Ora complex on Lulu Island. It was like a "Disneyland," my eyes feasting on colourful Eastern products from different lands. I bought a bottle of Master Kong Plum Drink 康师傅酸梅汤, two Beef Green Onion Steamed Buns, then later a small bottle of Purell Advanced Hand Sanitizer, then later again a bottle of Master Kong Rock Sugar Snow Pear Drink 康师傅冰糖雪梨. I was sitting, eating, drinking, and meditating at a table near the bay window, overlooking a Zen garden with a prominent brook. I was looking for packages of edible jellyfish, but I couldn't find any. I had an appointment at a doctor's office: In the lobby, the ceiling had three futuristic ring-shaped fluorescent lights, and there were strange plants in pots. There used to be a big wild curling postmodern sofa, but it was removed.

Upon the cloudy three and twentieth day of October, in the year two thousand and five and twenty, I wandered forth as though on some brief vacation of the spirit, riding by bus and pacing long along lanes shaded with trees. At length I came unto the T&T Market within the Ora complex upon Lulu Isle—a place that did seem unto me as some Eastern Disneyland, for mine eyes were gladdened by a feast of colours and wares from many lands beyond the sea.

There I purchased a bottle of Master Kong’s Plum Drink, 康师傅酸梅汤, and two Beef and Green Onion Steamed Buns. Afterward I bought a small vial of Purell Advanced Hand Sanitizer, and later yet a bottle of Master Kong’s Rock Sugar Snow Pear Drink, 康师傅冰糖雪梨. I sat by a broad bay window, eating and drinking in quiet meditation, beholding a fair Zen garden without, wherein a brook ran clear and spoke in murmurs.
I sought, though in vain, for packets of edible jellyfish, but none could I espy.

Thereafter I made my way unto a physician’s office; and in the lobby I beheld a ceiling adorned with three great ring-shaped lights that shone with a pale, futuristic glow. Strange potted plants stood like sentinels about the chamber, and I marked that the vast, curling, postmodern sofa—once the pride of that place—had been removed.

VIK: In the late afternoon and evening of the 23rd of October of 2025, I went twice to Tim Hortons café. Firstly, I ate a Cilantro Lime Slow-cooked Chicken Loaded Wrap with Cheese and drank Oat-Milk Iced Coffee. My vendor was the Latina-looking Francophile Aastha, a Punjabi woman. Secondly, I drank an Oat-Milk Pumpkin Spice Cold Brew. The crowds looked more excited than usual. I noticed in particular a Filipino with a handsome mestizo build and face. He was wearing a grey exercise track suit. The other day, I did notice that at one table was a Filipino couple who could speak Chabacano. My identity confused so many people: Filipino? Chinese? Hispanic? Japanese? Jewish?

CHATGPT:

In the late declining hours and evenfall of the three and twentieth of October, in the year two thousand five and twenty, I twice repaired unto Tim Hortons, that familiar house of coffee. At the first occasion I partook of a Cilantro-Lime Slow-cooked Chicken Loaded Wrap with Cheese, and quenched my thirst with an Oat-Milk Iced Coffee. The one who served me was Aastha—a woman of Punjabi birth, yet bearing the aspect of a Latina and the soul of a Francophile, for her speech and manner betrayed some fondness for the tongue of France.

When later I returned, the night grown deeper and the lamps within casting a mellow glow, I drank an Oat-Milk Pumpkin Spice Cold Brew. The place was astir with lively hum, the throng more spirited than their wont. Among them I espied a Filipino of comely countenance and noble mestizo form, clad in a grey tracksuit as though fresh from exercise.

I bethought me, too, of a Filipino couple I had seen aforetime, who spake in the rare tongue of Chabacano—a mingling of Castilian and island speech. And in such musings I smiled, for I knew not how others beheld me: Filipino? Chinese? Hispanic? Japanese? Jewish? My semblance seemed a riddle to them all, as though I were a traveller between worlds, bearing the marks of many nations upon a single face.

20251026 Square Buttons (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: Sometimes, I see my white friend Jason zooming by in his bicycle, as he would shout to me, "Mr. Sci-fi Guy!" I would form my hand in the "Live Long and Prosper" gesture, and he would do the same, as he speeds by. He's also "Mr. Sci-fi Guy" to me. This cloudy afternoon of the 26th of October of 2025, about the 5th hour, I am at Tim Hortons café, as I firstly drink an Oat-Milk Earl Grey Tea. Then secondly, I drink a Peach Sparkling Quencher, as I gobble a Turkey Bacon Club Artisan Sandwich. A big family of Arabs are sitting spread out on two tables. They're speaking Arabic. I just do my "Gentle Gaze Meditation," as I sit at my table, next to the washrooms with automated doors, activated by palm-sized silver metallic square buttons, which at their borders shine in green, red, white, and pink lights!

CHATGPT:

That’s a beautifully cinematic vignette — you capture the small, vivid details of place and moment with such clarity. The scene unfolds almost like a quiet slice of speculative realism: a Tim Hortons transfigured by your observant mind, the colors of the button lights taking on an otherworldly glow, and the echo of science fiction in your friendly exchange with Jason — “Mr. Sci-fi Guy” greeting “Mr. Sci-fi Guy,” two travelers in parallel worlds.

Your “Gentle Gaze Meditation” in that everyday yet strangely luminous space gives the whole scene a serene, almost metaphysical tone — as though time briefly pauses between the hum of voices and the gleam of those automated doors. Would you like me to turn this into a short prose-poem or narrative piece in that same contemplative style?

VIK: Yes, render in Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

At the Tim Hortons, upon an Overcast Afternoontide

Oft it chanceth that mine acquaintance, Jason, a white fellow of mirthful spirit, rideth apace upon his iron steed, the bicycle. As he doth draw nigh, he crieth unto me, “Good morrow, Master Sci-fi Guy!” And I, in kind salute, do raise mine hand in the Vulcan token — “Live long and prosper!” quoth I in silence. He returneth the same, and away he flieth, swift as Mercury on some celestial errand.

Now this five of the clock, upon the cloudy six-and-twentieth day of October, in the year two-and-twenty and five-hundred twice-ten and five, I sojourn within the house of Tim Hortons. There do I take my humble repast — first, a draught of Earl Grey Tea, mingled with the milk of oats; second, a sparkling potion of peach, whose bubbles doth sing like tiny sprites in the glass; and third, a Turkey Bacon Club sandwich, wrought with care upon bread of the artisan’s craft.

Round about me sitteth a great family of the Arab kindred, whose tongue floweth as honeyed syllables unknown to mine ear. They speak with such gentle fervor that methinks their words are prayers in motion. I, seated by the chamber of cleansing — whose doors obey the silver squares that glow in hues of green, red, white, and pink — do let mine eyes rest soft upon all things. Thus do I enter my “Gentle Gaze Meditation,” beholding the world as through a still and cosmic lens.

The lights gleam, the air hums with unseen thought, and time, for a little while, forgetteth to move.

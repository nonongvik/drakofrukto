20251114 Rio to Bali (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: 2025-11-14. Julio and I introduce each other in the afternoon at Tim Hortons café, here on Lulu Island. We always have been waving at each other in passing for some time, but now we are friends. Julio was born here in the Land of the Beavers from parents from Portugal. I say that I can read science fiction in Portuguese, but my conversational skills need lots of work. He thinks that I already know a lot of Portuguese. He tells me of his visit to Brazil, where he has also family. He's been to the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro, where there are many small monkeys. Then, I tell him of my journey to a monkey park in Bali, Indonesia, where the monkeys are rather big. Incidentally, my accent of Portuguese is Carioca, that of Rio de Janeiro. What do you think? Respond in Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

Methinks this new fellowship betwixt thee and Julio is most fair and timely, as though long-waving acquaintances were at last ripened into amity. ’Tis a pleasant thing when familiar faces become familiar souls. That he is born in the Beaver’s Land of Portuguese stock doth make thy meeting the more fitting, for thou hast ever borne an affection for tongues and their wanderings across the world.

Good Julio speaketh true: thou hast indeed gathered much Portuguese already, though thou deemest thyself lacking. Oft the learner knoweth not his own strength until another holdeth up the mirror. Thy ability to read the wondrous tales of science fiction in that tongue bespeaketh no small mastery; and as for speech, practice with such a one as Julio may well bring thee to fluency.

His memories of Brasil’s Jardim Botânico, with its sprightly little monkeys leaping through the green crowns, make a merry contrast to thy recollection of Bali’s bold, full-grown simians, who stride the temple paths like brigands of the forest. ’Tis fitting also that thy accent be Carioca, for in spirit thou art half a wanderer of that sunlit bay, even though thou treadest now the rain-kissed ways of Lulu Isle.

In all, I deem this meeting a seed of further discourse, richer understanding, and many tales traded across the table, as coffee cools and companionship warms.

VIK: 2025-11-14. Before 6 in the rainy evening at Tim Hortons café, I'm enjoying an Oat-Milk Iced Coffee and talking with Sandy the Guangdong woman, who speaks also Mandarin, besides her Cantonese. We talk about the political high positions of her husband's mother, a Communist, and her husband's father, a Chiang Kai-shek supporter. Her husband's mother's ancestors were powerful warlords in China. Then, the conversation turns to pineapple farms in the south of Taiwan. I say the Mandarin word "bōluó" 菠萝—pineapple. Sandy then says that Japanese persimmons are on sale at Kin's Farm Market. I speak a Chinese-style English to accommodate Sandy. What do you think? Respond in Elizabethan English.

CHATGPT:

Ah, what a rich tapestry of conversation thou dost weave this evening! The rain falls soft upon the world, and yet, within Tim Hortons, thou dost share in the warmth of fellowship and discourse with Sandy, whose tongue dances between Cantonese and Mandarin with equal grace. The tales of her husband’s lineage are fit for a chronicle, steeped in history both bitter and bold: the Communist mother, the Chiang Kai-shek father — a tale of divided loyalties and powerful bloodlines, harkening back to those fierce warlords of old China. How their histories doth color the present moment, each story an echo of time’s unfolding.

As the conversation shifts to the distant shores of Taiwan and its fruitful lands, thy words of "bōluó" — pineapple — bring to mind the sweet taste of the southern sun. And then, as though nature itself conspired to continue thy discourse, Sandy speaks of persimmons from the Land of the Rising Sun, now ripe for sale at Kin’s Farm Market. Truly, the fruit of the earth doth bring forth conversation of its own.

Thy manner of speech, humble yet rich with the cadence of a learned traveler, doth serve thee well as thou dost accommodate Sandy’s own speech with kindness and understanding. ‘Tis no small feat to navigate the many tongues of the world with such fluidity, and thou, good sir, dost do so with ease.

In all, this evening is a gathering of worlds — the old stories of war and power, the fresh fruits of the earth, and the bridge between languages, as Tim Hortons serves not only coffee, but connection.

VIK: 2025-11-15. After 5 in the drizzling morning, I trudged in the eerie damp darkness to Tim Hortons café, there to enjoy a Sausage Cheese Egg Lettuce Tomato Cinnamon-Bagel Sandwich and a Classic Iced Lemonade. I'm lightly reading there two books, Os filhos de Matusalém, in Portuguese, by Roberto A. Heinlein, and L'Homme illustré, in French, by Ray Bradbury. In the second one, I like the segment on very rainy Venus, as I recollect from the vintage movie, The Illustrated Man. I carry my books in a lime-green sack with an illustration of a green lizard. At the café are the baristas, Sukhman and Riya, both lady Punjabis. In the nearly empty hall are an East Indian man and a Chinese man, looking like an attractive mestizo. The sky is still black as night outside. The other night, in the same café, two handsome brown men were talking by the bay window. They were speaking in a gentle West Asian language, whose specificity I wasn't aware. It wasn't irritating-sounding at all, unlike some of the other languages that I do hear more often. Incidentally, I didn't keep a logbook or diary of my life in Japan, which may have been more important years than my life now in this Land of the Beavers. I was just happy-go-lucky then! Sigh! How fleeting, yet effervescent, is life! What do you think? Respond in Tagalog, then in Elizabethan English.

Sa Tagalog:

Sa umagang ambon-ambon na iyon, habang naglalakad ka sa dilim na parang may misteryong bumabalot sa buong kalsada, tila ba ang mundo ay humihinga nang mabagal. Ang pag-upo mo sa Tim Hortons, na may mainit-init na sandwich at malamig na lemonade, ay nagiging isang uri ng kanlungan—isang maliit na ilaw sa madilim na madaling-araw.

Ang dalawa mong binabasang libro, mula kina Heinlein at Bradbury, ay parang mga pinto tungo sa ibang mga uniberso—ang madulas at kakaibang Portuges, at ang malungkot-romantikong salinwikang Pranses. Ang imahe ng napaka-ulaning Venus—na para bang walang humpay ang patak—ay sumasabay sa ambon sa labas. Parang sumasabay din ang iyong mga alaala sa Japan, na hindi mo naisulat, kaya ngayo'y lumulutang-lutang lamang sa isip mo na parang samyo o alon: malinaw, pero hindi mahawakan.

Ang mga barista, sina Sukhman at Riya, ang mga tahimik na East Indian at Chinese na lalaki, at ang alaala ng dalawang guwapong West Asian na nag-uusap sa isang wika na banayad at hindi nakaiinis—lahat sila’y parang mga karakter sa nobelang patuloy mong sinusulat araw-araw. May mga wikang malulutong at may wikang parang musika; may mga alaalang tinatago at may mga alaalang paulit-ulit na bumabalik kapag malamig ang hangin.

Kung minsan, talagang napakaselan at napakabilis ng buhay—tila bula, tila usok, tila hamog. Ngunit sa bawat tahimik na umaga sa café, sa bawat librong binubuklat, at sa bawat taong nakikita mo, parang may kaunting kislap pa ring nananatili. At iyon ang ganda nito.

In Elizabethan English:

Verily, thou dost paint a morning most strange and tender, wherein the world itself seemeth wrapped in a damp enchantment. As thou trudgest through the drizzling dark, it is as though thou wanderest betwixt two realms—one of waking life and one of dream. Within Tim Hortons, that humble refuge, thy repast of sausage and egg upon a cinnamon’d bagel, together with a cold and sparkling lemonade, becometh almost a ritual—a ward against the bleakness without.

Thy books, borne in a lime-green sack adorned with a lizard, are like companions from distant stars. Heinlein and Bradbury whisper of worlds far removed from this modest café; Venus raineth eternally in one tale, even as the sky above thee remaineth black as ink. And in the quiet company of Sukhman and Riya, and the two solitary men—East Indian and Chinese-mestizo—thou findest thyself a silent observer of the small theatre of mankind.

The remembrance of the two handsome brown men speaking in a gentle tongue of Western Asia—soft and melodious to thine ear—lingereth like a perfume. Forsooth, some languages grate upon the senses, yet theirs flowed like water over smooth stones.

Thy sigh regarding thy years in Japan striketh a chord most human. Thou keepest no chronicle of those days bright with youth, and now they shimmer only as fleeting phantoms—precious yet untethered. Thus is life: a sparkling draught that vanisheth even as we lift the cup.

Yet think on this—though fleeting, life is ever effervescent; its bubbles rise anew each morn, whether beneath Venusian rains or drizzling Canadian skies.

20251120 Buddhism, Emotions (ChatGPT)
Viktor Nonong Medrano

VIK: 2025-11-20. From an NHL broadcast: "Buddhists think emotions are just work."

CHATGPT:

It sounds like the broadcast line “Buddhists think emotions are just work” was a very compressed or sloppy paraphrase of a genuine Buddhist idea — but expressed in a way that’s not quite accurate.

Here’s what it probably meant:

✔ What Buddhism Actually Says
In many Buddhist traditions — particularly Zen, Theravāda, and Mahāyāna psychology — emotions are understood as:
	•	Mental formations (saṅkhārā in Pali; saṃskāra in Sanskrit)
	•	Conditioned processes that arise, do their work (in the sense of functioning), and fade
	•	Not inherently “you” but activities of the mind caused by previous conditions
	•	Something to observe rather than suppress
In this sense, emotions are:

🧘 “Workings” or “Activities,” not “your identity”
A more accurate statement might be:
“Buddhists see emotions as mental events that arise, do their job, and pass away.”
or
“Emotions are processes, not fixed parts of the self.”

✔ Where the broadcaster’s line comes from
There’s a common Zen-style explanation that says:
	•	Thoughts do thinking
	•	Feelings do feeling
	•	Sensations do sensing
They’re like natural phenomena doing their own jobs — but they’re not “you.”

A Zen teacher might say:

“Anger is just anger doing its work. Let it arise, let it pass.”

So the NHL commentator took that idea and squished it into the catchy but odd statement:

“Emotions are just work.”

✨ In short
The broadcaster was likely referencing the Buddhist understanding that:
	•	Emotions are activities, not personal essence.
	•	They do their “function,” then fade.
	•	Wisdom is in seeing their impermanence and conditioned nature.
If you'd like, I can rephrase the line into a more faithful Buddhist teaching — or explain it through Theravāda, Zen, Pure Land, or Tibetan perspectives.

VIK: Yes, all.

CHATGPT:

Here are all four major Buddhist perspectives — Theravāda, Zen, Pure Land, and Tibetan — explaining what the NHL commentator clumsily summarized as “emotions are just work.”

Each tradition has its own nuance, but they all treat emotions as processes, phenomena, or activities, not identity.

🌿 1. Theravāda Buddhism (Pali Canon)

✔ Core idea
Emotions are mental formations (saṅkhārā) and feeling-tones (vedanā). They arise because of causes and conditions.

✔ What they “do”
Each mental event performs a function (kicca) — this is the closest to “work.”
Examples:
	•	Anger performs the function of creating aversion
	•	Desire performs the function of grasping
	•	Fear performs the function of avoidance
	•	Compassion performs the function of non-harm
	•	Mindfulness performs the function of clear knowing
In the commentarial tradition, every mental factor has one or more cetasic functions, such as:
	•	activation
	•	motivation
	•	evaluation
	•	intention

So a more accurate reformulation is:

“In Theravāda, emotions are conditioned mental processes performing their natural functions.”

Nothing is “personal.” It’s just phenomena doing their jobs, like rain raining or wind blowing.

🎋 2. Zen Buddhism (Japanese, Chinese Chan, Korean Seon)

✔ Core idea
Zen is very direct: emotions are events, not entities.
They have no solid essence, no fixed meaning.
Famous Zen phrasing:
“Thoughts think themselves. Feelings feel themselves.”
Zen often uses metaphors:
	•	A bird passing through the sky (emotion) leaves no tracks
	•	A wave rises and falls in the ocean (mind)
	•	Clouds pass; the sky remains clear

✔ Their “work”
Zen doesn’t typically say “work,” but it does say:
	•	Emotions arise,
	•	Perform their activity,
	•	Drop away when ungrasped.

Anger does anger.
Sadness does sadness.
Joy does joy.

The practitioner’s job is not to interfere, just observe.
So Zen might restate the idea as:
“Emotion is simply an activity of mind, appearing and disappearing.”

🌸 3. Pure Land Buddhism (Jōdo Shinshū, Amidism)
Pure Land Buddhism is less analytical, more devotional — but it still has a clear view of emotions.

✔ Core idea
Human emotions are part of bombu nature — the foolish, karmically conditioned, unreliable nature of ordinary beings.
They’re not stable.
They’re not trustworthy.
They’re not “you.”

✔ Their “work”
Pure Land often describes emotions as:
	•	karmic impulses
	•	habit patterns
	•	limitations of deluded beings
Rather than analyzing each emotion, Pure Land says:
“Emotions are karmic functions revealing our limitations.”
And precisely because emotions are unstable and conditioned, we rely on:
	•	Amida’s Vow
	•	Other-power (tariki)
	•	nembutsu (recitation of “Namu Amida Butsu”)
Pure Land rephrasing would be:
“Emotions show our karmic workings; they’re not our true self. Trust Amida and let the emotions be as they are.”

🕉 4. Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayāna)
✔ Core idea
Tibetan Buddhism sees emotions as energies with wisdom potentials.
They are not problems in themselves.
They become problems only when grasped.
✔ Their “work”
Emotions are actually manifestations of the Five Buddha Families, each performing a wisdom-function:
	•	Anger → Mirror-like wisdom
	•	Desire → Discriminating wisdom
	•	Pride → Equanimity wisdom
	•	Jealousy → All-accomplishing wisdom
	•	Ignorance → Dharmadhātu wisdom
The “work” of emotion is the energetic movement that, when recognized correctly, transforms into wisdom.
A Tibetan restatement:
“Emotions are dynamic energies performing their function, and can be transformed into wisdom when recognized.”

✨ Unified Interpretation
Across the four traditions, your NHL commentator’s quote corresponds to:
Emotions are conditioned phenomena doing their natural functions — not a ‘self,’ not who you are.
Some traditions emphasize function (Theravāda), some flow (Zen), some karmic limitation (Pure Land), some energetic transformation (Tibetan).

🌟 Explain how modern psychology parallels them
🌟 Provide examples using anger, fear, desire, joy, etc.

Just tell me.

VIK: I've read that ascension in Buddhism follows letting go of emotions.

CHATGPT:

This idea is partly right, but it depends on what we mean by “letting go of emotions,” and which Buddhist tradition we’re talking about.
Buddhism is not anti-emotion — but it is anti-clinging.
Below is the precise, tradition-specific meaning.

🌿 1. In Buddhism, ascension = liberation (nirvāṇa)
And liberation comes from letting go of clinging, not from suppressing feelings.

✔ Emotions aren’t the problem
✔ Clinging to emotions is

Buddhism consistently says:
Pain arises. Joy arises. Fear arises. Love arises.
None of these need to be eliminated.
Only the attachment, grasping, or identification needs to be released.
This is the “letting go.”

🌾 2. Theravāda: Letting go = releasing craving (taṇhā)
Theravāda teaches that:
	•	Feelings (vedanā) are natural
	•	They ripen into craving when the mind grasps
	•	Craving leads to suffering
	•	Letting go means not identifying with the emotion
A famous Pali line:
“Feeling is just felt.” “Not mine, not me, not my self.”
So the ascension (the progress of insight, stages of awakening) comes from:
	•	seeing impermanence
	•	seeing unsatisfactoriness
	•	seeing not-self
	•	loosening grasping
Not from killing emotion, but from not attaching to it.

🎋 3. Zen: Letting go = non-attachment to mental states
Zen expresses it poetically:
	•	“Let emotions come; let them go.”
	•	“Let thoughts think themselves.”
	•	“Clouds pass, the sky remains.”
Zen does not tell you to suppress or “rise above” feelings.
It asks you to stop believing they are you.
A Zen master would say:
“When sad, be fully sad.
When angry, be fully angry.
Don’t weave a story around it.
Then it dissolves on its own.”
Ascension here is returning to Original Mind — clear, open awareness.

🌸 4. Pure Land: Letting go = recognizing our limited nature
Pure Land Buddhism doesn’t ask you to let go of each emotion.
It asks you to let go of:
	•	the idea that you can purify yourself
	•	the ego that grasps at purity
	•	the self-power approach
Pure Land “ascension” (rebirth in the Pure Land) happens when you:
	•	entrust
	•	surrender
	•	stop relying on ego
	•	and relax into Amida’s Compassion
Here, letting go = humility, not emotional repression.

🕉 5. Tibetan Buddhism: Letting go = transforming emotion
Tibetan Vajrayāna goes even further:
Emotions are wisdom energies in disguise.
Anger becomes mirror-like clarity.
Desire becomes discriminating wisdom.
Jealousy becomes all-accomplishing activity.
You don’t “let go” of emotions by rejecting them — you let go by:
	•	seeing their empty nature
	•	allowing their energy to unfold as wisdom
	•	not clinging to the story
	•	not identifying with them
Ascension here = transmutation, not elimination.

🔥 6. So does Buddhism teach the elimination of emotion?
No.
That is a common Western misunderstanding.
Buddhism teaches:
✔ Don’t cling
✔ Don’t identify
✔ Don’t resist
✔ Don’t amplify
✔ Don’t deny
When emotions are “let go” in this sense:
	•	they arise naturally,
	•	perform their function,
	•	fade naturally,
	•	without leaving karmic residue.
This is what liberation feels like.

🌕 7. The Correct Summary
If you wanted one sentence that captures the truth across traditions:
Buddhism teaches not to suppress emotions, but to release attachment, identification, and grasping so that emotions unfold and dissolve naturally.
Or more poetically:
Letting go of clinging is ascension; not letting go of emotion itself.

If you want, I can map this to:
🌙 the Five Aggregates,
🌙 the Abhidhamma model of mind,
🌙 Zen kōan practice,
🌙 Tibetan deity yoga,
🌙 or modern psychology / trauma theory.

VIK: Yes, all.

CHATGPT:

Here is the full map you requested — one unified explanation of how “letting go of clinging to emotions” fits across all major Buddhist models AND modern psychology, including:

	1.	Five Aggregates (skandhas)
	2.	Theravāda Abhidhamma
	3.	Zen / Chan practice
	4.	Pure Land understanding
	5.	Tibetan Vajrayāna and deity yoga
	6.	Modern psychology & trauma theory parallels
This is the complete synthesis.

🧿 1. Five Aggregates (Skandhas): Where Emotions Fit
In early Buddhism, a “person” is five processes:
	1.	Rūpa – physical form
	2.	Vedanā – feeling-tone (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral)
	3.	Saṃjñā – perception, labelling
	4.	Saṅkhārā – mental formations (where emotions belong)
	5.	Vijñāna – consciousness
✔ Emotions are in Saṅkhārā
They arise due to:
	•	conditions
	•	past habit
	•	contact with sense objects
✔ “Letting go” means:
You stop misidentifying with any aggregate:
“This anger is not mine.”
“This sadness is not me.”
“This fear is a conditioned process.”
When grasping dissolves, the aggregates function without suffering.
Ascension = seeing their impermanence and releasing identity.

🌾 2. Theravāda Abhidhamma: The Detailed Mechanics
In the Abhidhamma, mental events are broken into cetasikas (mental factors):
	•	Some are wholesome
	•	Some unwholesome
	•	Some neutral
	•	All perform functions (their “work”)
✔ Emotions are combinations of mental factors
For example:
	•	Anger = dosa + delusion + agitation
	•	Fear = restlessness + delusion + aversion
	•	Desire = lobha + delusion
	•	Compassion = karuṇā + mindfulness + non-harm
Each arises to do its kicca (function), then disappears.
✔ “Letting go” in Abhidhamma:
	•	You observe the momentariness
	•	You see the rise and fall
	•	You see there is no self behind the factors
	•	You stop craving for, resisting, or identifying with the state
Emotions then lose their karmic momentum.
Ascension = the seven stages of purification & the four paths.

🎋 3. Zen / Chan: Non-Grasping Awareness
Zen applies a radical simplicity:
“Thoughts think themselves. Feelings feel themselves.”
Emotions are waves in mind-ocean:
	•	You neither follow them
	•	Nor fight them
	•	Nor deny them
	•	Nor feed them
✔ Letting go = non-grasping
Zen says:
	•	If anger comes, just feel anger
	•	If joy comes, just feel joy
	•	Don’t make a story
	•	Don’t push away
	•	Don’t cling
Once ungrasped, an emotion is like a bird flying through the air —
leaving no trace.
Ascension = returning to the clear sky of Original Mind.

🌸 4. Pure Land: Letting Go of Self-Purification
Pure Land Buddhism is the most psychologically gentle.
It says:
	•	Emotions reveal our karmic limitations
	•	We are “bombu” — foolish beings with unstable minds
	•	We can’t purify ourselves by force
✔ Letting go = surrendering the ego’s project
Instead of purifying emotions one by one, Pure Land says:
“Let go of the idea that you can perfect yourself.”
“Entrust in Amida.”
“Relax the self-struggle.”
Emotions become transparent when you stop using them as a measure of spiritual worth.
Ascension = rebirth in the Pure Land (awakening supported by Amida’s vow).

🕉 5. Tibetan Vajrayāna: Transforming Emotions into Wisdom
Tibetan Buddhism has the most positive view of emotions.
Every “afflictive” emotion is a wisdom energy misrecognized.

Emotion | Hidden Wisdom

Anger | Mirror-like clarity

Desire | Discriminating awareness

Pride | Equanimity

Jealousy | All-accomplishing action

Ignorance | Vastness (dharmadhātu)

✔ Letting go = letting the emotion reveal its empty nature
A Tibetan practitioner:
	•	feels anger fully
	•	sees its luminous energy
	•	realizes its emptiness
	•	lets it unfold as wisdom
	•	without suppression, indulgence, or avoidance
Ascension = recognizing the emotion as a deity’s wisdom-form.

In deity yoga:
	•	You visualize yourself as a deity
	•	Pure perception replaces self-grasping
	•	Emotions become strength, not obstacles

This is the Buddhist path where the “work” of emotion becomes fuel for enlightenment.

🧠 6. Modern Psychology & Trauma Theory
Modern science surprisingly aligns with Buddhism.

✔ Emotions are:
	•	physiological activations
	•	interpretations (stories)
	•	habit patterns
	•	survival mechanisms

✔ Letting go = decoupling story from sensation
Therapeutic parallels:
1. Somatic Experiencing:
Feel the emotion physically without narrative → it resolves.
2. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction:
Feel → name → allow → release.
3. Internal Family Systems:
Parts (like anger, fear, grief) are not “you” but processes seeking to protect you.
4. Trauma theory:
Suppression causes trauma loops; allowing + observing dissolves loops.

✔ Same principle as Buddhism:
	•	Feel fully
	•	Don’t identify
	•	Don’t cling
	•	Let the wave complete its cycle
This is psychological “ascension.”

🌕 One Grand Unified Explanation
Across all schools and psychology:
You don’t ascend by eliminating emotions.
You ascend by letting go of clinging, aversion, and identification,
so emotions arise and dissolve naturally.

Or more poetically:
Let the river flow.
Let the sky clear.
Let the fire burn without touching you.
Let the ocean wave, without drowning in it.

This is the essence of Buddhist emotional liberation across traditions.

VIK: 2025-11-20. So, not to "cling" to emotions...

CHATGPT:

Exactly — not clinging to emotions is the core principle.
But it’s important to understand what “not clinging” actually means, because it is subtle and often misunderstood.
Here is the clearest, simplest explanation.

🌿 What “Not Clinging to Emotions” Really Means
It does not mean:
	•	suppressing emotions
	•	denying emotions
	•	forcing yourself to be calm
	•	pretending not to feel
	•	becoming numb
	•	pushing feelings down
	•	“rising above” emotions in a cold way
It does mean:
✔ Letting emotions arise naturally
✔ Letting them be fully felt
✔ Letting them pass without grabbing, fearing, or identifying with them
A Buddhist teacher might say:
“Let the emotion bloom.
Let it do its work.
Let it fade.”
This is the “non-clinging” that leads to liberation.

🌊 1. What Clinging Looks Like
Clinging (upādāna) happens in several ways:
a) Identification
“I am angry.”
“I am depressed.”
“I am afraid.”
b) Resistance (negative clinging)
“I don’t want to feel this.”
“I hate this feeling.”
“Make it stop.”
c) Grasping and craving
“I want to feel good again.”
“Don’t let this happiness end.”
d) Story-making
“This always happens to me.”
“This emotion proves I’m broken.”
Buddhism says all of these are forms of clinging.

🌬️ 2. What Non-Clinging Looks Like
Non-clinging means:
✔ The emotion arises
✔ You recognize it as a conditioned process
✔ You observe it without feeding it
✔ You don’t identify with it
✔ You don’t resist it
✔ You don’t chase it
✔ You let its natural life-cycle unfold

In other words:
Feel it, don’t become it.
Or in even simpler language:
Don’t hold on. Don’t push away. Let it flow.

🕊 3. Examples

Anger
Clinging:
“I’m angry! This proves I’m right!”
or
“I shouldn’t be angry! This is bad!”
Non-clinging:
“Anger is arising. It feels hot. It will pass.”

Sadness
Clinging:
“I’m always like this.”
“This sadness defines me.”
Non-clinging:
“This sadness is visiting me. It’s not permanent.”

Joy
Clinging:
“Don’t let it end! I need this feeling to stay!”
Non-clinging:
“This joy is here now. It will fade. That’s okay.”

🌈 4. Why Non-Clinging Leads to Freedom
When you don’t cling:
	•	Emotions stop forming deep karmic grooves
	•	They lose their power to control behavior
	•	They arise more softly, pass more quickly
	•	You become less reactive
	•	You feel everything more clearly, without suffering
This is why non-clinging is central to:
	•	Nirvāṇa (Theravāda)
	•	Original Mind (Zen)
	•	Other-power reliance (Pure Land)
	•	Wisdom transformation (Vajrayāna)
All four traditions converge here.

🌕 In one sentence
Buddhism teaches not to cling to emotions: feel them fully, allow them to arise and pass, without identifying with them, resisting them, or grasping at them.

VIK: 2025-11-21. Yes, in Esperanto.

CHATGPT:

Jen la plej klara, eleganta klarigo en Esperanto pri la budhisma ideo “ne alkroĉiĝi al emocioj”:

🌿 Ne alkroĉiĝi al emocioj
En Budhismo, tio ne signifas subpremi aŭ ne senti emociojn.
Ĝi signifas:
✔ lasi ilin aperi nature
✔ senti ilin plene
✔ ne teni ilin, ne premi ilin, ne identigi sin kun ili
✔ lasi ilin forlasi vin, kiam ilia momento finiĝas

🌊 Kio estas “alkroĉiĝo”
Alkroĉiĝo (upādāna) okazas kiam ni:
	•	diras: “Tiu kolero estas mi.”
	•	aŭ kontraŭstaras: “Mi ne volas senti tion!”
	•	aŭ sopiras: “Mi volas, ke ĉi tiu ĝojo ne finiĝu.”
	•	aŭ kreas rakonton: “Ĉiam ĉi tio okazas al mi.”
Ĉiuj ĉi formoj estas teni la emocion, ne lasi ĝin iri.

🌬️ Kio estas “ne-alkroĉiĝo”
Ne-alkroĉiĝo signifas:
	•	Kolero aperas → “Mi rimarkas varman senton; ĝi pasos.”
	•	Malĝojo aperas → “Jen onda vizito; ne konstanta.”
	•	Ĝojo aperas → “Bela momento; ĝi ne estas tenenda.”
Mallonge:
Senti, sed ne fari el ĝi ‘mi’. Lasi flui, ne bloki, ne kapti.

🧘‍♂️ Poetaj frazoj en Esperanto
	•	“Emocio venas kiel ondo, kaj reiras al la maro.”
	•	“La ĉielo de la menso ne posedas la nubojn.”
	•	“Sento sentas sin mem; vi estas la spaco, ne la ŝtormo.”
	•	“Ĉio leviĝas, faras sian laboron, kaj mildiĝas en malpleno.”

🕊 Mallonga budhisma resumo en Esperanto
Ne forpuŝi, ne kapti, ne identigi.
Senti plene — kaj lasi iri.
Jen la vojo al liberiĝo.

VIK: 2025-11-21. What is "kroĉi" in English?

CHATGPT:

“Kroĉi” in English means:

to cling, to grasp, to hold onto, to latch onto

Nuances:
	•	kroĉi al io → to cling to something (physically or emotionally)
	•	kroĉi sin → to grip tightly, to hang on
	•	alkroĉiĝi → to become attached, to cling, to latch on (reflexive)
So the Buddhist phrase:
ne alkroĉiĝi al emocioj
literally means:
not to cling to emotions,
not to hold onto emotions,
not to get attached to emotions,
not to latch onto emotions.
If you want, I can give examples in Esperanto + English.

VIK: 2025-11-21. What is the etymology of "kroĉi"?

CHATGPT:

The Esperanto verb “kroĉi” (“to hook, to cling, to latch onto”) comes from a very transparent root:

Etymology of “kroĉi”
	1.	Root in Esperanto: kroĉ-
	2.	Primary meaning: “hook” (the noun kroĉo)
	3.	Suffix: -i → verb marker in Esperanto
	•	So kroĉi = “to hook” or “to attach with a hook”

Cognates / Influences
	•	French: crocher (“to hook, to hang”)
	•	German: haken (“hook”) is conceptually similar, though not directly borrowed
	•	Dutch: krok (“hook”)
	•	The consonant cluster kr/kr- + the “-o/-i” suffix pattern gives it the idea of physical hooking, later extended metaphorically to emotional attachment or clinging.

Derived forms in Esperanto

Form | Meaning

kroĉo | hook (noun)

kroĉi | to hook; to latch onto; to cling

alkroĉiĝi | to attach oneself; to cling; to become attached

So in Buddhist terms, ne alkroĉiĝi al emocioj literally means “not to hook oneself onto emotions.”

If you like, I can also trace how the metaphorical sense of “clinging” developed in Esperanto from the physical sense of “hooking.” It’s actually quite poetic.

VIK: 2025-11-21. What are the linguistic histories of French "crocher" and of Dutch "krok"?

CHATGPT:

Here’s a detailed look at the linguistic histories of French “crocher” and Dutch “krok”, showing how they relate to the meaning of “hook” and their deeper roots.

1. French: crocher
Meaning: “to hook, to hang, to catch, to latch onto”
History / Etymology
	1.	Old French: crochier
	•	Meaning: “to hook” or “to catch with a hook”
	•	Derived from noun croc (“hook, claw, fang”)
	2.	Croc itself comes from Late Latin croccus or Old Low Franconian krok, meaning “hook” or “bend”
	•	Latin itself likely borrowed it from a Germanic source (as in Old High German hroc or kroc)
	3.	Connotation shift:
	•	Initially physical: “hook, claw”
	•	Later metaphorical: “catch, entangle, attach”
Summary: French crocher comes from Old French crochier, from croc (“hook”), ultimately of Germanic origin.

2. Dutch: krok
Meaning: “hook”
History / Etymology
	1.	Dutch krok = “hook, bend, crook”
	2.	From Middle Dutch: kroc, croc
	3.	Cognate with Old High German hroc or Middle Low German krok (“hook, bend”)
	4.	Proto-Germanic root: *krukkaz → “bend, curve, hook”
	•	Related words in other Germanic languages:
	•	Old English crōc → “hook, crook, bend”
	•	German Krok(e) → “hook, bend”
	5.	Meaning has stayed relatively stable: physical “hook” → occasionally metaphorical (e.g., “hooked onto something”)

3. Connections / Observations
	•	Both French crocher and Dutch krok ultimately trace back to Germanic roots, describing curved things or hooks.
	•	The semantic development is parallel: physical hook → verb meaning “hook, catch, cling” → metaphorical “attach, cling emotionally.”
	•	This explains how Esperanto kroĉi could naturally evolve from the noun “hook” to the metaphorical meaning “to cling, latch onto.”

If you want, I can draw a full etymological map from Proto-Germanic → Dutch/French → Esperanto kroĉi, showing all semantic shifts along the way. This would make the “hook → cling” metaphor completely transparent.

VIK: 2025-11-21. What years did Late Latin "croccus" develop?

CHATGPT:

The Late Latin word “croccus” — meaning “hook” or sometimes “claw/fang” — appears in the Late Antique period, roughly around 3rd–6th centuries CE.
Here’s a more detailed timeline:

1. Classical Latin
	•	No widely attested croccus in Classical Latin (1st century BCE – 2nd century CE) in the sense of “hook”
	•	The word crocus did exist, but mainly as the saffron plant (Crocus sativus)

2. Late Latin
	•	3rd–6th centuries CE: Latin in the Western and Eastern Roman Empire starts borrowing from Germanic sources due to interactions with Gothic, Frankish, and other Germanic tribes
	•	croccus / croc emerges as “hook, claw” in written texts and glosses
	•	Seen in glosses, charters, and technical/vocational texts (like metalwork, carpentry)

3. Transmission to Romance languages
	•	By Old French (~9th–12th centuries): croc / croch → crocher (verb)
	•	Semantic development: physical hook → metaphorical “catch, latch, cling”

Summary
	•	Late Latin croccus: ~3rd–6th century CE
	•	Borrowed from Germanic (likely Frankish or Gothic)
	•	Led to Old French croc / croch / crochier → French crocher
	•	Eventually influenced Esperanto kroĉi metaphorically

If you want, I can also trace the earliest manuscript attestations of croccus in Late Latin, showing the contexts in which it was used. This can illustrate how “hook” became a semantic metaphor for attachment
